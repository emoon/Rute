/// This event is sent just before QWidget::hide() returns, and also
/// when a top-level window has been hidden (iconified) by the user.
///
/// If spontaneous() is true, the event originated outside the
/// application. In this case, the user hid the window using the
/// window manager controls, either by iconifying the window or by
/// switching to another virtual desktop where the window is not
/// visible. The window will become hidden but not withdrawn. If the
/// window was iconified, QWidget::isMinimized() returns `true.`
