///
/// Qt contains a set of QStyle subclasses that emulate the styles of
/// the different platforms supported by Qt (QWindowsStyle,
/// QMacStyle etc.). By default, these styles are built
/// into the Qt GUI module. Styles can also be made available as
/// plugins.
///
/// Qt's built-in widgets use QStyle to perform nearly all of their
/// drawing, ensuring that they look exactly like the equivalent
/// native widgets. The diagram below shows a QComboBox in nine
/// different styles.
///
/// ![Nine combo boxes](qstyle-comboboxes.png)
///
/// Topics:
///
/// # Setting a Style
///
/// The style of the entire application can be set using the
/// QApplication::setStyle() function. It can also be specified by the
/// user of the application, using the `-style` command-line option:
///
/// If no style is specified, Qt will choose the most appropriate
/// style for the user's platform or desktop environment.
///
/// A style can also be set on an individual widget using the
/// QWidget::setStyle() function.
///
/// # Developing Style-Aware Custom Widgets
///
/// If you are developing custom widgets and want them to look good on
/// all platforms, you can use QStyle functions to perform parts of
/// the widget drawing, such as drawItemText(), drawItemPixmap(),
/// drawPrimitive(), drawControl(), and drawComplexControl().
///
/// Most QStyle draw functions take four arguments:
/// * an enum value specifying which graphical element to draw
/// * a QStyleOption specifying how and where to render that element
/// * a QPainter that should be used to draw the element
/// * a QWidget on which the drawing is performed (optional)
///
/// For example, if you want to draw a focus rectangle on your
/// widget, you can write:
///
/// QStyle gets all the information it needs to render the graphical
/// element from QStyleOption. The widget is passed as the last
/// argument in case the style needs it to perform special effects
/// (such as animated default buttons on MacOS ), but it isn't
/// mandatory. In fact, you can use QStyle to draw on any paint
/// device, not just widgets, by setting the QPainter properly.
///
/// QStyleOption has various subclasses for the various types of
/// graphical elements that can be drawn. For example,
/// PE_FrameFocusRect expects a QStyleOptionFocusRect argument.
///
/// To ensure that drawing operations are as fast as possible,
/// QStyleOption and its subclasses have public data members. See the
/// QStyleOption class documentation for details on how to use it.
///
/// For convenience, Qt provides the QStylePainter class, which
/// combines a QStyle, a QPainter, and a QWidget. This makes it
/// possible to write
///
/// ...
///
/// instead of
///
/// ...
///
/// # Creating a Custom Style
///
/// You can create a custom look and feel for your application by
/// creating a custom style. There are two approaches to creating a
/// custom style. In the static approach, you either choose an
/// existing QStyle class, subclass it, and reimplement virtual
/// functions to provide the custom behavior, or you create an entire
/// QStyle class from scratch. In the dynamic approach, you modify the
/// behavior of your system style at runtime. The static approach is
/// described below. The dynamic approach is described in QProxyStyle.
///
/// The first step in the static approach is to pick one of the styles
/// provided by Qt from which you will build your custom style. Your
/// choice of QStyle class will depend on which style resembles your
/// desired style the most. The most general class that you can use as
/// a base is QCommonStyle (not QStyle). This is because Qt requires
/// its styles to be [QCommonStyle](QCommonStyle)
/// s.
///
/// Depending on which parts of the base style you want to change,
/// you must reimplement the functions that are used to draw those
/// parts of the interface. To illustrate this, we will modify the
/// look of the spin box arrows drawn by QWindowsStyle. The arrows
/// are *primitive elements* that are drawn by the drawPrimitive()
/// function, so we need to reimplement that function. We need the
/// following class declaration:
///
/// To draw its up and down arrows, QSpinBox uses the
/// PE_IndicatorSpinUp and PE_IndicatorSpinDown primitive elements.
/// Here's how to reimplement the drawPrimitive() function to draw
/// them differently:
///
/// Notice that we don't use the `widget` argument, except to pass it
/// on to the QWindowStyle::drawPrimitive() function. As mentioned
/// earlier, the information about what is to be drawn and how it
/// should be drawn is specified by a QStyleOption object, so there is
/// no need to ask the widget.
///
/// If you need to use the `widget` argument to obtain additional
/// information, be careful to ensure that it isn't 0 and that it is
/// of the correct type before using it. For example:
///
/// ...
///
/// When implementing a custom style, you cannot assume that the
/// widget is a QSpinBox just because the enum value is called
/// PE_IndicatorSpinUp or PE_IndicatorSpinDown.
///
/// The documentation for the [Styles](widgets/styles)
/// example
/// covers this topic in more detail.
///
/// **Warning**: Qt style sheets are currently not supported for custom QStyle
/// subclasses. We plan to address this in some future release.
///
/// # Using a Custom Style
///
/// There are several ways of using a custom style in a Qt
/// application. The simplest way is to pass the custom style to the
/// QApplication::setStyle() static function before creating the
/// QApplication object:
///
/// You can call QApplication::setStyle() at any time, but by calling
/// it before the constructor, you ensure that the user's preference,
/// set using the `-style` command-line option, is respected.
///
/// You may want to make your custom style available for use in other
/// applications, which may not be yours and hence not available for
/// you to recompile. The Qt Plugin system makes it possible to create
/// styles as plugins. Styles created as plugins are loaded as shared
/// objects at runtime by Qt itself. Please refer to the [Qt Plugin](How%20to%20Create%20Qt%20Plugins)
///
/// documentation for more information on how to go about creating a style
/// plugin.
///
/// Compile your plugin and put it into Qt's `plugins/styles`
/// directory. We now have a pluggable style that Qt can load
/// automatically. To use your new style with existing applications,
/// simply start the application with the following argument:
///
/// The application will use the look and feel from the custom style you
/// implemented.
///
/// # Right-to-Left Desktops
///
/// Languages written from right to left (such as Arabic and Hebrew)
/// usually also mirror the whole layout of widgets, and require the
/// light to come from the screen's top-right corner instead of
/// top-left.
///
/// If you create a custom style, you should take special care when
/// drawing asymmetric elements to make sure that they also look
/// correct in a mirrored layout. An easy way to test your styles is
/// to run applications with the `-reverse` command-line option or
/// to call QApplication::setLayoutDirection() in your `main()`
/// function.
///
/// Here are some things to keep in mind when making a style work well in a
/// right-to-left environment:
///
/// * subControlRect() and subElementRect() return rectangles in screen coordinates
/// * QStyleOption::direction indicates in which direction the item should be drawn in
/// * If a style is not right-to-left aware it will display items as if it were left-to-right
/// * visualRect(), visualPos(), and visualAlignment() are helpful functions that will translate from logical to screen representations.
/// * alignedRect() will return a logical rect aligned for the current direction
///
/// # Styles in Item Views
///
/// The painting of items in views is performed by a delegate. Qt's
/// default delegate, QStyledItemDelegate, is also used for calculating bounding
/// rectangles of items, and their sub-elements for the various kind
/// of item [data roles](Qt::ItemDataRole)
///
/// QStyledItemDelegate supports. See the QStyledItemDelegate class
/// description to find out which datatypes and roles are supported. You
/// can read more about item data roles in [Model/View Programming](Model/View%20Programming)
///
///
/// When QStyledItemDelegate paints its items, it draws
/// CE_ItemViewItem, and calculates their size with CT_ItemViewItem.
/// Note also that it uses SE_ItemViewItemText to set the size of
/// editors. When implementing a style to customize drawing of item
/// views, you need to check the implementation of QCommonStyle (and
/// any other subclasses from which your style
/// inherits). This way, you find out which and how
/// other style elements are painted, and you can then reimplement the
/// painting of elements that should be drawn differently.
///
/// We include a small example where we customize the drawing of item
/// backgrounds.
///
/// The primitive element PE_PanelItemViewItem is responsible for
/// painting the background of items, and is called from
/// [QCommonStyle](QCommonStyle)
/// 's implementation of CE_ItemViewItem.
///
/// To add support for drawing of new datatypes and item data roles,
/// it is necessary to create a custom delegate. But if you only
/// need to support the datatypes implemented by the default
/// delegate, a custom style does not need an accompanying
/// delegate. The QStyledItemDelegate class description gives more
/// information on custom delegates.
///
/// The drawing of item view headers is also done by the style, giving
/// control over size of header items and row and column sizes.
///

/// [`StylePainter`]
