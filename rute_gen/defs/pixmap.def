/// 
/// Qt provides four classes for handling image data: QImage, QPixmap,
/// QBitmap and QPicture. QImage is designed and optimized for I/O,
/// and for direct pixel access and manipulation, while QPixmap is
/// designed and optimized for showing images on screen. QBitmap is
/// only a convenience class that inherits QPixmap, ensuring a depth
/// of 1. The isQBitmap() function returns `true` if a QPixmap object is
/// really a bitmap, otherwise returns `false.` Finally, the QPicture class
/// is a paint device that records and replays QPainter commands.
/// 
/// A QPixmap can easily be displayed on the screen using QLabel or
/// one of QAbstractButton's subclasses (such as QPushButton and
/// QToolButton). QLabel has a pixmap property, whereas
/// QAbstractButton has an icon property.
/// 
/// QPixmap objects can be passed around by value since the QPixmap
/// class uses implicit data sharing. For more information, see the [Implicit Data Sharing](Implicit%20Data%20Sharing)
/// documentation. QPixmap objects can also be
/// streamed.
/// 
/// Note that the pixel data in a pixmap is internal and is managed by
/// the underlying window system. Because QPixmap is a QPaintDevice
/// subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto pixmaps.
/// Pixels can only be accessed through QPainter functions or by
/// converting the QPixmap to a QImage. However, the fill() function
/// is available for initializing the entire pixmap with a given color.
/// 
/// There are functions to convert between QImage and
/// QPixmap. Typically, the QImage class is used to load an image
/// file, optionally manipulating the image data, before the QImage
/// object is converted into a QPixmap to be shown on
/// screen. Alternatively, if no manipulation is desired, the image
/// file can be loaded directly into a QPixmap.
/// 
/// QPixmap provides a collection of functions that can be used to
/// obtain a variety of information about the pixmap. In addition,
/// there are several functions that enables transformation of the
/// pixmap.
/// 
/// # Reading and Writing Image Files
/// 
/// QPixmap provides several ways of reading an image file: The file
/// can be loaded when constructing the QPixmap object, or by using
/// the load() or loadFromData() functions later on. When loading an
/// image, the file name can either refer to an actual file on disk or
/// to one of the application's embedded resources. See [The Qt
/// Resource System](The%20Qt%0A%20%20%20%20Resource%20System)
/// overview for details on how to embed images and
/// other resource files in the application's executable.
/// 
/// Simply call the save() function to save a QPixmap object.
/// 
/// The complete list of supported file formats are available through
/// the QImageReader::supportedImageFormats() and
/// QImageWriter::supportedImageFormats() functions. New file formats
/// can be added as plugins. By default, Qt supports the following
/// formats:
/// 
/// * Format
/// * Description
/// * Qt's support
/// * BMP
/// * Windows Bitmap
/// * Read/write
/// * GIF
/// * Graphic Interchange Format (optional)
/// * Read
/// * JPG
/// * Joint Photographic Experts Group
/// * Read/write

/// * Portable Pixmap
/// * Read/write
/// * XBM
/// * X11 Bitmap
/// * Read/write
/// * XPM
/// * X11 Pixmap
/// * Read/write
/// 
/// # Pixmap Information
/// 
/// QPixmap provides a collection of functions that can be used to
/// obtain a variety of information about the pixmap:
/// 
/// 
/// * Available Functions
/// 
/// * Geometry
/// * The size(), width() and height() functions provide information about the pixmap's size. The rect() function returns the image's enclosing rectangle.
/// 
/// * Alpha component
/// * The hasAlphaChannel() returns `true` if the pixmap has a format that respects the alpha channel, otherwise returns `false.` The hasAlpha(), setMask() and mask() functions are legacy and should not be used. They are potentially very slow. The createHeuristicMask() function creates and returns a 1-bpp heuristic mask (i.e. a QBitmap) for this pixmap. It works by selecting a color from one of the corners and then chipping away pixels of that color, starting at all the edges. The createMaskFromColor() function creates and returns a mask (i.e. a QBitmap) for the pixmap based on a given color.
/// 
/// * Low-level information
/// * The depth() function returns the depth of the pixmap. The defaultDepth() function returns the default depth, i.e. the depth used by the application on the given screen. The cacheKey() function returns a number that uniquely identifies the contents of the QPixmap object. The x11Info() function returns information about the configuration of the X display used by the screen to which the pixmap currently belongs. The x11PictureHandle() function returns the X11 Picture handle of the pixmap for XRender support. Note that the two latter functions are only available on x11.
/// 
/// # Pixmap Conversion
/// 
/// A QPixmap object can be converted into a QImage using the
/// toImage() function. Likewise, a QImage can be converted into a
/// QPixmap using the fromImage(). If this is too expensive an
/// operation, you can use QBitmap::fromImage() instead.
/// 
/// To convert a QPixmap to and from HICON you can use the QtWinExtras
/// functions QtWin::toHICON() and QtWin::fromHICON() respectively.
/// 
/// # Pixmap Transformations
/// 
/// QPixmap supports a number of functions for creating a new pixmap
/// that is a transformed version of the original:
/// 
/// The scaled(), scaledToWidth() and scaledToHeight() functions
/// return scaled copies of the pixmap, while the copy() function
/// creates a QPixmap that is a plain copy of the original one.
/// 
/// The transformed() function returns a copy of the pixmap that is
/// transformed with the given transformation matrix and
/// transformation mode: Internally, the transformation matrix is
/// adjusted to compensate for unwanted translation,
/// i.e. transformed() returns the smallest pixmap containing all
/// transformed points of the original pixmap. The static trueMatrix()
/// function returns the actual matrix used for transforming the
/// pixmap.
/// 
/// **Note**: When using the native X11 graphics system, the pixmap
/// becomes invalid when the QApplication instance is destroyed.
