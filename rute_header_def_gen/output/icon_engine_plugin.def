///     \class QIconEnginePlugin
///     \brief The QIconEnginePlugin class provides an abstract base for custom QIconEngine plugins.
/// 
///     \ingroup plugins
///     \inmodule QtGui
/// 
///     The icon engine plugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it easy to
///     create custom icon engines that can be loaded dynamically into applications
///     through QIcon. QIcon uses the file or resource name's suffix to determine
///     what icon engine to use.
/// 
///     Writing a icon engine plugin is achieved by subclassing this base class,
///     reimplementing the pure virtual function create(), and
///     exporting the class with the Q_PLUGIN_METADATA() macro.
/// 
///     The json metadata should contain a list of icon engine keys that this plugin supports.
///     The keys correspond to the suffix of the file or resource name used when the plugin was
///     created. Keys are case insensitive.
/// 
///     \code
///     { "Keys": [ "myiconengine" ] }
///     \endcode
