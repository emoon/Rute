/// 
/// QMdiArea functions, essentially, like a window manager for MDI
/// windows. For instance, it draws the windows it manages on itself
/// and arranges them in a cascading or tile pattern. QMdiArea is
/// commonly used as the center widget in a QMainWindow to create MDI
/// applications, but can also be placed in any layout. The following
/// code adds an area to a main window:
/// 
/// Unlike the window managers for top-level windows, all window flags
/// (Qt::WindowFlags) are supported by QMdiArea as long as the flags
/// are supported by the current widget style. If a specific flag is
/// not supported by the style (e.g., the
/// [WindowShadeButtonHint](Qt::)
/// ), you can still shade the window
/// with showShaded().
/// 
/// Subwindows in QMdiArea are instances of QMdiSubWindow. They
/// are added to an MDI area with addSubWindow(). It is common to pass
/// a QWidget, which is set as the internal widget, to this function,
/// but it is also possible to pass a QMdiSubWindow directly.The class
/// inherits QWidget, and you can use the same API as with a normal
/// top-level window when programming. QMdiSubWindow also has behavior
/// that is specific to MDI windows. See the QMdiSubWindow class
/// description for more details.
/// 
/// A subwindow becomes active when it gets the keyboard focus, or
/// when setFocus() is called. The user activates a window by moving
/// focus in the usual ways. The MDI area emits the
/// subWindowActivated() signal when the active window changes, and
/// the activeSubWindow() function returns the active subwindow.
/// 
/// The convenience function subWindowList() returns a list of all
/// subwindows. This information could be used in a popup menu
/// containing a list of windows, for example.
/// 
/// The subwindows are sorted by the current
/// [WindowOrder](QMdiArea::)
/// . This is used for the subWindowList()
/// and for activateNextSubWindow() and activatePreviousSubWindow().
/// Also, it is used when cascading or tiling the windows with
/// cascadeSubWindows() and tileSubWindows().
/// 
/// QMdiArea provides two built-in layout strategies for
/// subwindows: cascadeSubWindows() and tileSubWindows(). Both are
/// slots and are easily connected to menu entries.
