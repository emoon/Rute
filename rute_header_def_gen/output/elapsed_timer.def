/// 
/// The QElapsedTimer class is usually used to quickly calculate how much
/// time has elapsed between two events. Its API is similar to that of QTime,
/// so code that was using that can be ported quickly to the new class.
/// 
/// However, unlike QTime, QElapsedTimer tries to use monotonic clocks if
/// possible. This means it's not possible to convert QElapsedTimer objects
/// to a human-readable time.
/// 
/// The typical use-case for the class is to determine how much time was
/// spent in a slow operation. The simplest example of such a case is for
/// debugging purposes, as in the following example:
/// 
/// In this example, the timer is started by a call to start() and the
/// elapsed timer is calculated by the elapsed() function.
/// 
/// The time elapsed can also be used to recalculate the time available for
/// another operation, after the first one is complete. This is useful when
/// the execution must complete within a certain time period, but several
/// steps are needed. The `waitFor` -type functions in QIODevice and its
/// subclasses are good examples of such need. In that case, the code could
/// be as follows:
/// 
/// Another use-case is to execute a certain operation for a specific
/// timeslice. For this, QElapsedTimer provides the hasExpired() convenience
/// function, which can be used to determine if a certain number of
/// milliseconds has already elapsed:
/// 
/// It is often more convenient to use [QDeadlineTimer](QDeadlineTimer)
/// in this case, which
/// counts towards a timeout in the future instead of tracking elapsed time.
/// 
/// # Reference Clocks
/// 
/// QElapsedTimer will use the platform's monotonic reference clock in all
/// platforms that support it (see QElapsedTimer::isMonotonic()). This has
/// the added benefit that QElapsedTimer is immune to time adjustments, such
/// as the user correcting the time. Also unlike QTime, QElapsedTimer is
/// immune to changes in the timezone settings, such as daylight-saving
/// periods.
/// 
/// On the other hand, this means QElapsedTimer values can only be compared
/// with other values that use the same reference. This is especially true if
/// the time since the reference is extracted from the QElapsedTimer object
/// (QElapsedTimer::msecsSinceReference()) and serialised. These values
/// should never be exchanged across the network or saved to disk, since
/// there's no telling whether the computer node receiving the data is the
/// same as the one originating it or if it has rebooted since.
/// 
/// It is, however, possible to exchange the value with other processes
/// running on the same machine, provided that they also use the same
/// reference clock. QElapsedTimer will always use the same clock, so it's
/// safe to compare with the value coming from another process in the same
/// machine. If comparing to values produced by other APIs, you should check
/// that the clock used is the same as QElapsedTimer (see
/// QElapsedTimer::clockType()).
/// 
/// ## 32-bit overflows
/// 
/// Some of the clocks used by QElapsedTimer have a limited range and may
/// overflow after hitting the upper limit (usually 32-bit). QElapsedTimer
/// deals with this overflow issue and presents a consistent timing. However,
/// when extracting the time since reference from QElapsedTimer, two
/// different processes in the same machine may have different understanding
/// of how much time has actually elapsed.
/// 
/// The information on which clocks types may overflow and how to remedy that
/// issue is documented along with the clock types.
