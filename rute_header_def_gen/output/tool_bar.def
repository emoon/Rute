/// 
/// Toolbar buttons are added by adding *actions,* using addAction()
/// or insertAction(). Groups of buttons can be separated using
/// addSeparator() or insertSeparator(). If a toolbar button is not
/// appropriate, a widget can be inserted instead using addWidget() or
/// insertWidget(). Examples of suitable widgets are QSpinBox,
/// QDoubleSpinBox, and QComboBox. When a toolbar button is pressed, it
/// emits the actionTriggered() signal.
/// 
/// A toolbar can be fixed in place in a particular area (e.g., at the
/// top of the window), or it can be movable between toolbar areas;
/// see setMovable(), isMovable(), allowedAreas() and isAreaAllowed().
/// 
/// When a toolbar is resized in such a way that it is too small to
/// show all the items it contains, an extension button will appear as
/// the last item in the toolbar. Pressing the extension button will
/// pop up a menu containing the items that do not currently fit in
/// the toolbar.
/// 
/// When a QToolBar is not a child of a QMainWindow, it loses the ability
/// to populate the extension pop up with widgets added to the toolbar using
/// addWidget(). Please use widget actions created by inheriting QWidgetAction
/// and implementing QWidgetAction::createWidget() instead.
