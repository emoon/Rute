///     \class QChildEvent
///     \inmodule QtCore
///     \brief The QChildEvent class contains event parameters for child object
///     events.
/// 
///     \ingroup events
/// 
///     Child events are sent immediately to objects when children are
///     added or removed.
/// 
///     In both cases you can only rely on the child being a QObject (or,
///     if QObject::isWidgetType() returns \c true, a QWidget). This is
///     because in the QEvent::ChildAdded case the child is not yet fully
///     constructed; in the QEvent::ChildRemoved case it might have
///     already been destructed.
/// 
///     The handler for these events is QObject::childEvent().
struct ChildEvent : Event {
    child() -> Object?,
    added() -> bool,
    polished() -> bool,
    removed() -> bool,
}
