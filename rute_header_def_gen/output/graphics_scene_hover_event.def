///     \class QGraphicsSceneHoverEvent
///     \brief The QGraphicsSceneHoverEvent class provides hover events
///            in the graphics view framework.
///     \since 4.2
///     \ingroup graphicsview-api
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     When a QGraphicsView receives a QHoverEvent event, it translates
///     it into QGraphicsSceneHoverEvent. The event is then forwarded to
///     the QGraphicsScene associated with the view.
/// 
///     \sa QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent, QGraphicsSceneContextMenuEvent,
