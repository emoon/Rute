///     \class QFocusFrame
///     \brief The QFocusFrame widget provides a focus frame which can be
///     outside of a widget's normal paintable area.
/// 
///     \ingroup basicwidgets
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     Normally an application will not need to create its own
///     QFocusFrame as QStyle will handle this detail for
///     you. A style writer can optionally use a QFocusFrame to have a
///     focus area outside of the widget's paintable geometry. In this way
///     space need not be reserved for the widget to have focus but only
///     set on a QWidget with QFocusFrame::setWidget. It is, however,
///     legal to create your own QFocusFrame on a custom widget and set
///     its geometry manually via QWidget::setGeometry however you will
///     not get auto-placement when the focused widget changes size or
///     placement.
