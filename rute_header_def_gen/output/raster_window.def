///   \brief QRasterWindow is a convenience class for using QPainter on a QWindow.
/// 
///   QRasterWindow is a QWindow with a raster-based, non-OpenGL surface. On top of
///   the functionality offered by QWindow, QRasterWindow adds a virtual
///   paintEvent() function and the possibility to open a QPainter on itself. The
///   underlying paint engine will be the raster one, meaning that all drawing will
///   happen on the CPU. For performing accelerated, OpenGL-based drawing, use
///   QOpenGLWindow instead.
/// 
///   Internally the class is thin wrapper for QWindow and QBackingStore
///   and is very similar to the \l{Raster Window Example}{Raster Window
///   Example} that uses these classes directly.
/// 
///   \sa QPaintDeviceWindow::paintEvent(), QPaintDeviceWindow::update()
struct RasterWindow : PaintDeviceWindow {
    ///   \internal
    [event] redirected(arg0: *PointType) -> PaintDevice?,
}
