/// 
/// QRasterWindow is a QWindow with a raster-based, non-OpenGL surface. On top of
/// the functionality offered by QWindow, QRasterWindow adds a virtual
/// paintEvent() function and the possibility to open a QPainter on itself. The
/// underlying paint engine will be the raster one, meaning that all drawing will
/// happen on the CPU. For performing accelerated, OpenGL-based drawing, use
/// QOpenGLWindow instead.
/// 
/// Internally the class is thin wrapper for QWindow and QBackingStore
/// and is very similar to the [Raster Window
/// Example](Raster%20Window%20Example)
/// that uses these classes directly.
