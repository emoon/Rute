/// 
/// This class is used by non-GUI applications to provide their event
/// loop. For non-GUI application that uses Qt, there should be exactly
/// one QCoreApplication object. For GUI applications, see
/// QGuiApplication. For applications that use the Qt Widgets module,
/// see QApplication.
/// 
/// QCoreApplication contains the main event loop, where all events
/// from the operating system (e.g., timer and network events) and
/// other sources are processed and dispatched. It also handles the
/// application's initialization and finalization, as well as
/// system-wide and application-wide settings.
/// 
/// # The Event Loop and Event Handling
/// 
/// The event loop is started with a call to exec(). Long-running
/// operations can call processEvents() to keep the application
/// responsive.
/// 
/// In general, we recommend that you create a QCoreApplication,
/// QGuiApplication or a QApplication object in your `main()`
/// function as early as possible. exec() will not return until
/// the event loop exits; e.g., when quit() is called.
/// 
/// Several static convenience functions are also provided. The
/// QCoreApplication object is available from instance(). Events can
/// be sent with sendEvent() or posted to an event queue with postEvent().
/// Pending events can be removed with removePostedEvents() or dispatched
/// with sendPostedEvents().
/// 
/// The class provides a quit() slot and an aboutToQuit() signal.
/// 
/// # Application and Library Paths
/// 
/// An application has an applicationDirPath() and an
/// applicationFilePath(). Library paths (see QLibrary) can be retrieved
/// with libraryPaths() and manipulated by setLibraryPaths(), addLibraryPath(),
/// and removeLibraryPath().
/// 
/// # Internationalization and Translations
/// 
/// Translation files can be added or removed
/// using installTranslator() and removeTranslator(). Application
/// strings can be translated using translate(). The QObject::tr()
/// and QObject::trUtf8() functions are implemented in terms of
/// translate().
/// 
/// # Accessing Command Line Arguments
/// 
/// The command line arguments which are passed to QCoreApplication's
/// constructor should be accessed using the arguments() function.
/// 
/// **Note**: QCoreApplication removes option `-qmljsdebugger="...".` It parses the
/// argument of `qmljsdebugger,` and then removes this option plus its argument.
/// 
/// For more advanced command line option handling, create a QCommandLineParser.
/// 
/// # Locale Settings
/// 
/// On Unix/Linux Qt is configured to use the system locale settings by
/// default. This can cause a conflict when using POSIX functions, for
/// instance, when converting between data types such as floats and
/// strings, since the notation may differ between locales. To get
/// around this problem, call the POSIX function `setlocale(LC_NUMERIC,"C")`
/// right after initializing QApplication, QGuiApplication or QCoreApplication
/// to reset the locale that is used for number formatting to -locale.

    /// * Installing an event filter on the object. Such an event filter gets all the events, including Tab and Shift+Tab key press events, as long as they do not change the focus widget.
