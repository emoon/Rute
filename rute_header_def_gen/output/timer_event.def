///     \class QTimerEvent
///     \inmodule QtCore
///     \brief The QTimerEvent class contains parameters that describe a
///     timer event.
/// 
///     \ingroup events
/// 
///     Timer events are sent at regular intervals to objects that have
///     started one or more timers. Each timer has a unique identifier. A
///     timer is started with QObject::startTimer().
/// 
///     The QTimer class provides a high-level programming interface that
///     uses signals instead of events. It also provides single-shot timers.
/// 
///     The event handler QObject::timerEvent() receives timer events.
/// 
///     \sa QTimer, QObject::timerEvent(), QObject::startTimer(),
///     QObject::killTimer()
