/// 
///     \brief The QInputMethodQueryEvent class provides an event sent by the input context to input objects.
/// 
///     It is used by the
///     input method to query a set of properties of the object to be
///     able to support complex input method operations as support for
///     surrounding text and reconversions.
/// 
///     queries() specifies which properties are queried.
/// 
///     The object should call setValue() on the event to fill in the requested
///     data before calling accept().
