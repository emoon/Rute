///     \class QContextMenuEvent
///     \brief The QContextMenuEvent class contains parameters that describe a context menu event.
///     \inmodule QtGui
/// 
///     \ingroup events
/// 
///     Context menu events are sent to widgets when a user performs
///     an action associated with opening a context menu.
///     The actions required to open context menus vary between platforms;
///     for example, on Windows, pressing the menu button or clicking the
///     right mouse button will cause this event to be sent.
/// 
///     When this event occurs it is customary to show a QMenu with a
///     context menu, if this is relevant to the context.
/// 
///     Context menu events contain a special accept flag that indicates
///     whether the receiver accepted the event. If the event handler does
///     not accept the event then, if possible, whatever triggered the event will be
///     handled as a regular input event.
