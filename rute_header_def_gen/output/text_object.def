/// The common grouping text objects are lists (QTextList), frames
/// (QTextFrame), and tables (QTextTable). A text object has an
/// associated format() and document().
/// 
/// There are essentially two kinds of text objects: those that are used
/// with blocks (block formats), and those that are used with characters
/// (character formats). The first kind are derived from QTextBlockGroup,
/// and the second kind from QTextFrame.
/// 
/// You rarely need to use this class directly. When creating custom text
/// objects, you will also need to reimplement QTextDocument::createObject()
/// which acts as a factory method for creating text objects.
