///     \class QAccessibleBridge
///     \brief The QAccessibleBridge class is the base class for
///     accessibility back-ends.
///     \internal
/// 
///     \ingroup accessibility
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     Qt supports Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), \macos
///     Accessibility, and the Unix/X11 AT-SPI standard. By subclassing
///     QAccessibleBridge, you can support other backends than the
///     predefined ones.
/// 
///     Currently, custom bridges are only supported on Unix. We might
///     add support for them on other platforms as well if there is
///     enough demand.
