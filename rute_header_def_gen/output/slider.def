///     \class QSlider
///     \brief The QSlider widget provides a vertical or horizontal slider.
/// 
///     \ingroup basicwidgets
///     \inmodule QtWidgets

///     \image windows-slider.png
/// 
///     The slider is the classic widget for controlling a bounded value.
///     It lets the user move a slider handle along a horizontal or vertical
///     groove and translates the handle's position into an integer value
///     within the legal range.
/// 
///     QSlider has very few of its own functions; most of the functionality is in
///     QAbstractSlider. The most useful functions are setValue() to set
///     the slider directly to some value; triggerAction() to simulate
///     the effects of clicking (useful for shortcut keys);
///     setSingleStep(), setPageStep() to set the steps; and setMinimum()
///     and setMaximum() to define the range of the scroll bar.
/// 
///     QSlider provides methods for controlling tickmarks.  You can use
///     setTickPosition() to indicate where you want the tickmarks to be,
///     setTickInterval() to indicate how many of them you want. the
///     currently set tick position and interval can be queried using the
///     tickPosition() and tickInterval() functions, respectively.
/// 
///     QSlider inherits a comprehensive set of signals:
///     \table
///     \header \li Signal \li Description
///     \row \li \l valueChanged()
///     \li Emitted when the slider's value has changed. The tracking()
///        determines whether this signal is emitted during user
///        interaction.
///     \row \li \l sliderPressed()
///     \li Emitted when the user starts to drag the slider.
///     \row \li \l sliderMoved()
///     \li Emitted when the user drags the slider.
///     \row \li \l sliderReleased()
///     \li Emitted when the user releases the slider.
///     \endtable
/// 
///     QSlider only provides integer ranges. Note that although
///     QSlider handles very large numbers, it becomes difficult for users
///     to use a slider accurately for very large ranges.
/// 
///     A slider accepts focus on Tab and provides both a mouse wheel and a
///     keyboard interface. The keyboard interface is the following:
/// 
///     \list
///         \li Left/Right move a horizontal slider by one single step.
///         \li Up/Down move a vertical slider by one single step.
///         \li PageUp moves up one page.
///         \li PageDown moves down one page.
///         \li Home moves to the start (mininum).
///         \li End moves to the end (maximum).
///     \endlist
///
