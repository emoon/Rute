/// QUndoView is a QListView which displays the list of commands pushed on an undo stack.
/// The most recently executed command is always selected. Selecting a different command
/// results in a call to QUndoStack::setIndex(), rolling the state of the document
/// backwards or forward to the new command.
/// 
/// The stack can be set explicitly with setStack(). Alternatively, a QUndoGroup object can
/// be set with setGroup(). The view will then update itself automatically whenever the
/// active stack of the group changes.
