///     QUndoView is a QListView which displays the list of commands pushed on an undo stack.
///     The most recently executed command is always selected. Selecting a different command
///     results in a call to QUndoStack::setIndex(), rolling the state of the document
///     backwards or forward to the new command.
/// 
///     The stack can be set explicitly with setStack(). Alternatively, a QUndoGroup object can
///     be set with setGroup(). The view will then update itself automatically whenever the
///     active stack of the group changes.
