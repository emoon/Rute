///     \brief The QHBoxLayout class lines up widgets horizontally.
/// 
///     \ingroup geomanagement
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     This class is used to construct horizontal box layout objects. See
///     QBoxLayout for details.
/// 
///     The simplest use of the class is like this:

///     \snippet layouts/layouts.cpp 2
///     \codeline
///     \snippet layouts/layouts.cpp 3
///     \snippet layouts/layouts.cpp 4
///     \snippet layouts/layouts.cpp 5
/// 
///     First, we create the widgets we want in the layout. Then, we
///     create the QHBoxLayout object and add the widgets into the
///     layout. Finally, we call QWidget::setLayout() to install the
///     QHBoxLayout object onto the widget. At that point, the widgets in
///     the layout are reparented to have \c window as their parent.
