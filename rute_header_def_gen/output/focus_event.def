///     \class QFocusEvent
///     \brief The QFocusEvent class contains event parameters for widget focus
///     events.
///     \inmodule QtGui
/// 
///     \ingroup events
/// 
///     Focus events are sent to widgets when the keyboard input focus
///     changes. Focus events occur due to mouse actions, key presses
///     (such as \uicontrol{Tab} or \uicontrol{Backtab}), the window system, popup
///     menus, keyboard shortcuts, or other application-specific reasons.
///     The reason for a particular focus event is returned by reason()
///     in the appropriate event handler.
/// 
///     The event handlers QWidget::focusInEvent(),
///     QWidget::focusOutEvent(), QGraphicsItem::focusInEvent and
///     QGraphicsItem::focusOutEvent() receive focus events.
/// 
///     \sa QWidget::setFocus(), QWidget::setFocusPolicy(), {Keyboard Focus in Widgets}
