/// Focus events are sent to widgets when the keyboard input focus

/// menus, keyboard shortcuts, or other application-specific reasons.
/// The reason for a particular focus event is returned by reason()
/// in the appropriate event handler.
/// 
/// The event handlers QWidget::focusInEvent(),
/// QWidget::focusOutEvent(), QGraphicsItem::focusInEvent and
/// QGraphicsItem::focusOutEvent() receive focus events.
