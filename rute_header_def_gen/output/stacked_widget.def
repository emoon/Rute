/// 
/// QStackedWidget can be used to create a user interface similar to
/// the one provided by QTabWidget. It is a convenience layout widget
/// built on top of the QStackedLayout class.
/// 
/// Like QStackedLayout, QStackedWidget can be constructed and
/// populated with a number of child widgets ("pages"):
/// 
/// QStackedWidget provides no intrinsic means for the user to switch
/// page. This is typically done through a QComboBox or a QListWidget
/// that stores the titles of the QStackedWidget's pages. For
/// example:
/// 
/// When populating a stacked widget, the widgets are added to an
/// internal list. The indexOf() function returns the index of a
/// widget in that list. The widgets can either be added to the end of
/// the list using the addWidget() function, or inserted at a given
/// index using the insertWidget() function. The removeWidget()
/// function removes a widget from the stacked widget. The number of
/// widgets contained in the stacked widget can
/// be obtained using the count() function.
/// 
/// The widget() function returns the widget at a given index
/// position. The index of the widget that is shown on screen is given
/// by currentIndex() and can be changed using setCurrentIndex(). In a
/// similar manner, the currently shown widget can be retrieved using
/// the currentWidget() function, and altered using the
/// setCurrentWidget() function.
/// 
/// Whenever the current widget in the stacked widget changes or a
/// widget is removed from the stacked widget, the currentChanged()
/// and widgetRemoved() signals are emitted respectively.
