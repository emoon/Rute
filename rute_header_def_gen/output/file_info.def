/// 
/// QFileInfo provides information about a file's name and position
/// (path) in the file system, its access rights and whether it is a
/// directory or symbolic link, etc. The file's size and last
/// modified/read times are also available. QFileInfo can also be
/// used to obtain information about a Qt [resource](resource%0A%20%20%20%20system)
/// 
/// 
/// A QFileInfo can point to a file with either a relative or an
/// absolute file path. Absolute file paths begin with the directory
/// separator (or with a drive specification on Windows). Relative
/// file names begin with a directory name or a file name and specify
/// a path relative to the current working directory. An example of an
/// absolute path is the string . A relative path might
/// look like . You can use the function isRelative() to
/// check whether a QFileInfo is using a relative or an absolute file
/// path. You can call the function makeAbsolute() to convert a
/// relative QFileInfo's path to an absolute path.
/// 
/// The file that the QFileInfo works on is set in the constructor or
/// later with setFile(). Use exists() to see if the file exists and
/// size() to get its size.
/// 
/// The file's type is obtained with isFile(), isDir() and
/// isSymLink(). The symLinkTarget() function provides the name of the file
/// the symlink points to.
/// 
/// On Unix (including MacOS and iOS), the symlink has the same size() has
/// the file it points to, because Unix handles symlinks
/// transparently; similarly, opening a symlink using QFile
/// effectively opens the link's target. For example:
/// 
/// On Windows, symlinks (shortcuts) are `.lnk` files. The reported
/// size() is that of the symlink (not the link's target), and
/// opening a symlink using QFile opens the `.lnk` file. For
/// example:
/// 
/// Elements of the file's name can be extracted with path() and
/// fileName(). The fileName()'s parts can be extracted with
/// baseName(), suffix() or completeSuffix(). QFileInfo objects to
/// directories created by Qt classes will not have a trailing file
/// separator. If you wish to use trailing separators in your own file
/// info objects, just append one to the file name given to the constructors
/// or setFile().
/// 
/// The file's dates are returned by created(), lastModified(), lastRead() and
/// fileTime(). Information about the file's access permissions is
/// obtained with isReadable(), isWritable() and isExecutable(). The
/// file's ownership is available from owner(), ownerId(), group() and
/// groupId(). You can examine a file's permissions and ownership in a
/// single statement using the permission() function.
/// 
/// **Note**: On NTFS file systems, ownership and permissions checking is
/// disabled by default for performance reasons. To enable it,
/// include the following line:
/// 
/// Permission checking is then turned on and off by incrementing and
/// decrementing `qt_ntfs_permission_lookup` by 1.
/// 
/// # Performance Issues
/// 
/// Some of QFileInfo's functions query the file system, but for
/// performance reasons, some functions only operate on the
/// file name itself. For example: To return the absolute path of
/// a relative file name, absolutePath() has to query the file system.
/// The path() function, however, can work on the file name directly,
/// and so it is faster.
/// 
/// **Note**: To speed up performance, QFileInfo caches information about
/// the file.
/// 
/// Because files can be changed by other users or programs, or
/// even by other parts of the same program, there is a function that
/// refreshes the file information: refresh(). If you want to switch
/// off a QFileInfo's caching and force it to access the file system
/// every time you request information from it call setCaching(false).
