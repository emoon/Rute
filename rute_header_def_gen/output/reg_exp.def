/// **Keyword**: regular expression
/// 
/// A regular expression, or , is a pattern for matching
/// substrings in a text. This is useful in many contexts, e.g.,
/// 
/// * Validation
/// * A regexp can test whether a substring meets some criteria, e.g. is an integer or contains no whitespace.
/// * Searching
/// * A regexp provides more powerful pattern matching than simple substring matching, e.g., match one of the words *mail* , *letter* or *correspondence* , but none of the words *email* , *mailman* , *mailer* , *letterbox* , etc.
/// * Search and Replace
/// * A regexp can replace all occurrences of a substring with a different substring, e.g., replace all occurrences of *&* with *\&amp;* except where the *&* is already followed by an *amp;* .
/// * String Splitting
/// * A regexp can be used to identify where a string should be split apart, e.g. splitting tab-delimited strings.

/// A brief introduction to regexps is presented, a description of
/// Qt's regexp language, some examples, and the function
/// documentation itself. QRegExp is modeled on Perl's regexp
/// language. It fully supports Unicode. QRegExp can also be used in a
/// simpler, *wildcard mode* that is similar to the functionality
/// found in command shells. The syntax rules used by QRegExp can be
/// changed with setPatternSyntax(). In particular, the pattern syntax
/// can be set to QRegExp::FixedString, which means the pattern to be
/// matched is interpreted as a plain string, i.e., special characters
/// (e.g., backslash) are not escaped.
/// 
/// A good text on regexps is *Mastering Regular Expressions*
/// (Third Edition) by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl, ISBN 0-596-52812-4.
/// 
/// **Note**: In Qt 5, the new QRegularExpression class provides a Perl
/// compatible implementation of regular expressions and is recommended
/// in place of QRegExp.
/// 
/// # Introduction
/// 
/// Regexps are built up from expressions, quantifiers, and
/// assertions. The simplest expression is a character, e.g. **x**
/// or **5** . An expression can also be a set of characters
/// enclosed in square brackets. **[ABCD]** will match an **A**
/// or a **B** or a **C** or a **D** . We can write this same
/// expression as **[A-D]** , and an expression to match any
/// capital letter in the English alphabet is written as
/// **[A-Z]** .
/// 
/// A quantifier specifies the number of occurrences of an expression
/// that must be matched. **x{1,1** } means match one and only one
/// **x** . **x{1,5** } means match a sequence of **x**
/// characters that contains at least one **x** but no more than
/// five.
/// 
/// Note that in general regexps cannot be used to check for balanced
/// brackets or tags. For example, a regexp can be written to match an
/// opening html `<b>` and its closing `</b>` , if the `<b>` tags
/// are not nested, but if the `<b>` tags are nested, that same
/// regexp will match an opening `<b>` tag with the wrong closing
/// `</b>` . For the fragment `<b>bold <b>bolder</b></b>` , the
/// first `<b>` would be matched with the first `</b>` , which is
/// not correct. However, it is possible to write a regexp that will
/// match nested brackets or tags correctly, but only if the number of
/// nesting levels is fixed and known. If the number of nesting levels
/// is not fixed and known, it is impossible to write a regexp that
/// will not fail.
/// 
/// Suppose we want a regexp to match integers in the range 0 to 99.
/// At least one digit is required, so we start with the expression
/// **[0-9]{1,1** }, which matches a single digit exactly once. This
/// regexp matches integers in the range 0 to 9. To match integers up
/// to 99, increase the maximum number of occurrences to 2, so the
/// regexp becomes **[0-9]{1,2** }. This regexp satisfies the
/// original requirement to match integers from 0 to 99, but it will
/// also match integers that occur in the middle of strings. If we
/// want the matched integer to be the whole string, we must use the
/// anchor assertions, **^** (caret) and **$** (dollar). When
/// **^** is the first character in a regexp, it means the regexp
/// must match from the beginning of the string. When **$** is the
/// last character of the regexp, it means the regexp must match to
/// the end of the string. The regexp becomes **^[0-9]{1,2** $}.
/// Note that assertions, e.g. **^** and **$** , do not match
/// characters but locations in the string.
/// 
/// If you have seen regexps described elsewhere, they may have looked
/// different from the ones shown here. This is because some sets of
/// characters and some quantifiers are so common that they have been
/// given special symbols to represent them. **[0-9]** can be
/// replaced with the symbol **\\d** . The quantifier to match
/// exactly one occurrence, **{1,1** }, can be replaced with the
/// expression itself, i.e. **x{1,1** } is the same as **x** . So
/// our 0 to 99 matcher could be written as **^\\d{1,2** $}. It can
/// also be written **^\\d\\d{0,1** $}, i.e. *From the start of
/// the string, match a digit, followed immediately by 0 or 1 digits* .
/// In practice, it would be written as **^\\d\\d?$** . The **?**
/// is shorthand for the quantifier **{0,1** }, i.e. 0 or 1
/// occurrences. **?** makes an expression optional. The regexp
/// **^\\d\\d?$** means *From the beginning of the string, match
/// one digit, followed immediately by 0 or 1 more digit, followed
/// immediately by end of string* .
/// 
/// To write a regexp that matches one of the words 'mail' *or*
/// 'letter' *or* 'correspondence' but does not match words that
/// contain these words, e.g., 'email', 'mailman', 'mailer', and
/// 'letterbox', start with a regexp that matches 'mail'. Expressed
/// fully, the regexp is **m{1,1** a{1,1}i{1,1}l{1,1}}, but because
/// a character expression is automatically quantified by
/// **{1,1** }, we can simplify the regexp to **mail** , i.e., an
/// 'm' followed by an 'a' followed by an 'i' followed by an 'l'. Now
/// we can use the vertical bar **|** , which means **or** , to
/// include the other two words, so our regexp for matching any of the
/// three words becomes **mail|letter|correspondence** . Match
/// 'mail' **or** 'letter' **or** 'correspondence'. While this
/// regexp will match one of the three words we want to match, it will
/// also match words we don't want to match, e.g., 'email'. To
/// prevent the regexp from matching unwanted words, we must tell it
/// to begin and end the match at word boundaries. First we enclose
/// our regexp in parentheses, **(mail|letter|correspondence)** .
/// Parentheses group expressions together, and they identify a part
/// of the regexp that we wish to [capture](capturing%20text)
/// 
/// Enclosing the expression in parentheses allows us to use it as a
/// component in more complex regexps. It also allows us to examine
/// which of the three words was actually matched. To force the match
/// to begin and end on word boundaries, we enclose the regexp in
/// **\\b** *word boundary* assertions:
/// **\\b(mail|letter|correspondence)\\b** . Now the regexp means:
/// *Match a word boundary, followed by the regexp in parentheses,
/// followed by a word boundary* . The **\\b** assertion matches a
/// *position* in the regexp, not a *character.* A word boundary is
/// any non-word character, e.g., a space, newline, or the beginning
/// or ending of a string.
/// 
/// If we want to replace ampersand characters with the HTML entity
/// **\&amp;** , the regexp to match is simply **\&** . But this
/// regexp will also match ampersands that have already been converted
/// to HTML entities. We want to replace only ampersands that are not
/// already followed by **amp;** . For this, we need the negative
/// lookahead assertion, **(?!** __ **)** . The regexp can then be
/// written as **\&(?!amp;)** , i.e. *Match an ampersand that is*
/// **not** *followed by* **amp;** .
/// 
/// If we want to count all the occurrences of 'Eric' and 'Eirik' in a
/// string, two valid solutions are **\\b(Eric|Eirik)\\b** and
/// **\\bEi?ri[ck]\\b** . The word boundary assertion '\\b' is
/// required to avoid matching words that contain either name,
/// e.g. 'Ericsson'. Note that the second regexp matches more
/// spellings than we want: 'Eric', 'Erik', 'Eiric' and 'Eirik'.
/// 
/// Some of the examples discussed above are implemented in the
/// [code examples](%23code-examples)
/// section.
/// 
/// # Characters and Abbreviations for Sets of Characters
/// 
/// * Element
/// * Meaning
/// * **c**
/// * A character represents itself unless it has a special regexp meaning. e.g. **c** matches the character *c.*
/// * **\\c**
/// * A character that follows a backslash matches the character itself, except as specified below. e.g., To match a literal caret at the beginning of a string, write **\\^** .
/// * **\\a**
/// * Matches the ASCII bell (BEL, 0x07).
/// * **\\f**
/// * Matches the ASCII form feed (FF, 0x0C).
/// * **\\n**
/// * Matches the ASCII line feed (LF, 0x0A, Unix newline).
/// * **\\r**
/// * Matches the ASCII carriage return (CR, 0x0D).
/// * **\\t**
/// * Matches the ASCII horizontal tab (HT, 0x09).
/// * **\\v**
/// * Matches the ASCII vertical tab (VT, 0x0B).
/// * **\\x\e{hhhh** }
/// * Matches the Unicode character corresponding to the hexadecimal number *hhhh* (between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF).
/// * **\\0\e{ooo** } (i.e., \\zero *ooo* )
/// * matches the ASCII/Latin1 character for the octal number *ooo* (between 0 and 0377).
/// * **. (dot)**
/// * Matches any character (including newline).
/// * **\\d**
/// * Matches a digit (QChar::isDigit()).
/// * **\\D**
/// * Matches a non-digit.
/// * **\\s**
/// * Matches a whitespace character (QChar::isSpace()).
/// * **\\S**
/// * Matches a non-whitespace character.
/// * **\\w**
/// * Matches a word character (QChar::isLetterOrNumber(), QChar::isMark(), or '_').
/// * **\\W**
/// * Matches a non-word character.
/// * **\\\e{n** }
/// * The *n* -th backreference, e.g. \\1, \\2, etc.
/// 
/// **Note:** The C++ compiler transforms backslashes in strings.
/// To include a **\\** in a regexp, enter it twice, i.e. `\\` .
/// To match the backslash character itself, enter it four times, i.e.
/// `\\\\` .
/// 
/// # Sets of Characters
/// 
/// Square brackets mean match any character contained in the square
/// brackets. The character set abbreviations described above can
/// appear in a character set in square brackets. Except for the
/// character set abbreviations and the following two exceptions,
/// characters do not have special meanings in square brackets.
/// 
/// * **^**
/// * The caret negates the character set if it occurs as the first character (i.e. immediately after the opening square bracket). **[abc]** matches 'a' or 'b' or 'c', but **[^abc]** matches anything *but* 'a' or 'b' or 'c'.
/// * **-**
/// * The dash indicates a range of characters. **[W-Z]** matches 'W' or 'X' or 'Y' or 'Z'.
/// 
/// Using the predefined character set abbreviations is more portable
/// than using character ranges across platforms and languages. For
/// example, **[0-9]** matches a digit in Western alphabets but
/// **\\d** matches a digit in *any* alphabet.
/// 
/// Note: In other regexp documentation, sets of characters are often
/// called .
/// 
/// # Quantifiers
/// 
/// By default, an expression is automatically quantified by
/// **{1,1** }, i.e. it should occur exactly once. In the following
/// list, **\e {E** } stands for expression. An expression is a
/// character, or an abbreviation for a set of characters, or a set of
/// characters in square brackets, or an expression in parentheses.
/// 
/// * **\e {E** ?}
/// * Matches zero or one occurrences of *E.* This quantifier means *The previous expression is optional* , because it will match whether or not the expression is found. **\e
/// {E** ?} is the same as **\e {E** {0,1}}. e.g., **dents?** matches 'dent' or 'dents'.
/// * **\e {E** +}
/// * Matches one or more occurrences of *E.* **\e {E** +} is the same as **\e {E** {1,}}. e.g., **0+** matches '0', '00', '000', etc.
/// * **\e {E** *}
/// * Matches zero or more occurrences of *E.* It is the same as **\e {E** {0,}}. The ***** quantifier is often used in error where **+** should be used. For example, if **\\s*$** is used in an expression to match strings that end in whitespace, it will match every string because **\\s*$** means *Match zero or more whitespaces followed
/// by end of string* . The correct regexp to match strings that have at least one trailing whitespace character is **\\s+$** .
/// * **\e {E** {n}}
/// * Matches exactly *n* occurrences of *E.* **\e {E** {n}} is the same as repeating *E* *n* times. For example, **x{5** } is the same as **xxxxx** . It is also the same as **\e {E** {n,n}}, e.g. **x{5,5** }.
/// * **\e {E** {n,}}
/// * Matches at least *n* occurrences of *E.*
/// * **\e {E** {,m}}
/// * Matches at most *m* occurrences of *E.* **\e {E** {,m}} is the same as **\e {E** {0,m}}.
/// * **\e {E** {n,m}}
/// * Matches at least *n* and at most *m* occurrences of *E.*
/// 
/// To apply a quantifier to more than just the preceding character,
/// use parentheses to group characters together in an expression. For
/// example, **tag+** matches a 't' followed by an 'a' followed by
/// at least one 'g', whereas **(tag)+** matches at least one
/// occurrence of 'tag'.
/// 
/// Note: Quantifiers are normally . They always match as much
/// text as they can. For example, **0+** matches the first zero it
/// finds and all the consecutive zeros after the first zero. Applied
/// to '20005', it matches '2 **000** 5'. Quantifiers can be made
/// non-greedy, see setMinimal().
/// 
/// # Capturing Text
/// 
/// Parentheses allow us to group elements together so that we can
/// quantify and capture them. For example if we have the expression
/// **mail|letter|correspondence** that matches a string we know
/// that *one* of the words matched but not which one. Using
/// parentheses allows us to whatever is matched within
/// their bounds, so if we used **(mail|letter|correspondence)**
/// and matched this regexp against the string
/// we can use the cap() or capturedTexts() functions to extract the
/// matched characters, in this case 'mail'.
/// 
/// We can use captured text within the regexp itself. To refer to the
/// captured text we use *backreferences* which are indexed from 1,
/// the same as for cap(). For example we could search for duplicate
/// words in a string using **\\b(\\w+)\\W+\\1\\b** which means match a
/// word boundary followed by one or more word characters followed by
/// one or more non-word characters followed by the same text as the
/// first parenthesized expression followed by a word boundary.
/// 
/// If we want to use parentheses purely for grouping and not for
/// capturing we can use the non-capturing syntax, e.g.
/// **(?:green|blue)** . Non-capturing parentheses begin '(?:' and
/// end ')'. In this example we match either 'green' or 'blue' but we
/// do not capture the match so we only know whether or not we matched
/// but not which color we actually found. Using non-capturing
/// parentheses is more efficient than using capturing parentheses
/// since the regexp engine has to do less book-keeping.
/// 
/// Both capturing and non-capturing parentheses may be nested.
/// 
/// For historical reasons, quantifiers (e.g. ***** ) that apply to
/// capturing parentheses are more than other quantifiers.
/// For example, **a*(a*)** will match with cap(1) == .
/// This behavior is different from what other regexp engines do
/// (notably, Perl). To obtain a more intuitive capturing behavior,
/// specify QRegExp::RegExp2 to the QRegExp constructor or call
/// setPatternSyntax(QRegExp::RegExp2).
/// 
/// When the number of matches cannot be determined in advance, a
/// common idiom is to use cap() in a loop. For example:
/// 
/// # Assertions
/// 
/// Assertions make some statement about the text at the point where
/// they occur in the regexp but they do not match any characters. In
/// the following list **\e {E** } stands for any expression.
/// 
/// * **^**
/// * The caret signifies the beginning of the string. If you wish to match a literal `^` you must escape it by writing `\\^` . For example, **^#include** will only match strings which *begin* with the characters '#include'. (When the caret is the first character of a character set it has a special meaning, see [Sets of Characters](%23sets-of-characters)
/// .)
/// * **$**
/// * The dollar signifies the end of the string. For example **\\d\\s*$** will match strings which end with a digit optionally followed by whitespace. If you wish to match a literal `$` you must escape it by writing `\\$` .
/// * **\\b**
/// * A word boundary. For example the regexp **\\bOK\\b** means match immediately after a word boundary (e.g. start of string or whitespace) the letter 'O' then the letter 'K' immediately before another word boundary (e.g. end of string or whitespace). But note that the assertion does not actually match any whitespace so if we write **(\\bOK\\b)** and we have a match it will only contain 'OK' even if the string is "It's **OK** now".
/// * **\\B**
/// * A non-word boundary. This assertion is true wherever **\\b** is false. For example if we searched for **\\Bon\\B** in "Left on" the match would fail (space and end of string aren't non-word boundaries), but it would match in "t **on** ne".
/// * **(?=\e E)**
/// * Positive lookahead. This assertion is true if the expression matches at this point in the regexp. For example, **const(?=\\s+char)** matches 'const' whenever it is followed by 'char', as in 'static **const** char *'. (Compare with **const\\s+char** , which matches 'static **const char** *'.)
/// * **(?!\e E)**
/// * Negative lookahead. This assertion is true if the expression does not match at this point in the regexp. For example, **const(?!\\s+char)** matches 'const' *except* when it is followed by 'char'.
/// 
/// # Wildcard Matching
/// 
/// Most command shells such as *bash* or *cmd.exe* support , the ability to identify a group of files by using
/// wildcards. The setPatternSyntax() function is used to switch
/// between regexp and wildcard mode. Wildcard matching is much
/// simpler than full regexps and has only four features:
/// 
/// * **c**
/// * Any character represents itself apart from those mentioned below. Thus **c** matches the character *c.*
/// * **?**
/// * Matches any single character. It is the same as **.** in full regexps.
/// * *****
/// * Matches zero or more of any characters. It is the same as **.*** in full regexps.
/// * **[...]**
/// * Sets of characters can be represented in square brackets, similar to full regexps. Within the character class, like outside, backslash has no special meaning.
/// 
/// In the mode Wildcard, the wildcard characters cannot be
/// escaped. In the mode WildcardUnix, the character '\\' escapes the
/// wildcard.
/// 
/// For example if we are in wildcard mode and have strings which
/// contain filenames we could identify HTML files with ***.html** .
/// This will match zero or more characters followed by a dot followed
/// by 'h', 't', 'm' and 'l'.
/// 
/// To test a string against a wildcard expression, use exactMatch().
/// For example:
/// 
/// # Notes for Perl Users
/// 
/// Most of the character class abbreviations supported by Perl are
/// supported by QRegExp, see [characters and abbreviations for sets of characters](%23characters-and-abbreviations-for-sets-of-characters)
/// 
/// 
/// In QRegExp, apart from within character classes, `^` always
/// signifies the start of the string, so carets must always be
/// escaped unless used for that purpose. In Perl the meaning of caret
/// varies automagically depending on where it occurs so escaping it
/// is rarely necessary. The same applies to `$` which in
/// QRegExp always signifies the end of the string.
/// 
/// QRegExp's quantifiers are the same as Perl's greedy quantifiers
/// (but see the [note above](greedy%20quantifiers)
/// ). Non-greedy
/// matching cannot be applied to individual quantifiers, but can be
/// applied to all the quantifiers in the pattern. For example, to
/// match the Perl regexp **ro+?m** requires:
/// 
/// The equivalent of Perl's `/i` option is
/// setCaseSensitivity(Qt::CaseInsensitive).
/// 
/// Perl's `/g` option can be emulated using a [loop](%23cap_in_a_loop)
/// 
/// 
/// In QRegExp **.** matches any character, therefore all QRegExp
/// regexps have the equivalent of Perl's `/s` option. QRegExp
/// does not have an equivalent to Perl's `/m` option, but this
/// can be emulated in various ways for example by splitting the input
/// into lines or by looping with a regexp that searches for newlines.
/// 
/// Because QRegExp is string oriented, there are no \\A, \\Z, or \\z
/// assertions. The \\G assertion is not supported but can be emulated
/// in a loop.
/// 
/// Perl's $& is cap(0) or capturedTexts()[0]. There are no QRegExp
/// equivalents for $`, $' or $+. Perl's capturing variables, $1, $2,
/// ... correspond to cap(1) or capturedTexts()[1], cap(2) or
/// capturedTexts()[2], etc.
/// 
/// To substitute a pattern use QString::replace().
/// 
/// Perl's extended `/x` syntax is not supported, nor are
/// directives, e.g. (?i), or regexp comments, e.g. (?#comment). On
/// the other hand, C++'s rules for literal strings can be used to
/// achieve the same:
/// 
/// Both zero-width positive and zero-width negative lookahead
/// assertions (?=pattern) and (?!pattern) are supported with the same
/// syntax as Perl. Perl's lookbehind assertions,
/// subexpressions and conditional expressions are not supported.
/// 
/// Non-capturing parentheses are also supported, with the same
/// (?:pattern) syntax.
/// 
/// See QString::split() and QStringList::join() for equivalents
/// to Perl's split and join functions.
/// 
/// Note: because C++ transforms \\'s they must be written *twice* in
/// code, e.g. **\\b** must be written **\\\\b** .
/// 
/// # Code Examples
/// 
/// The third string matches ' **6** '. This is a simple validation
/// regexp for integers in the range 0 to 99.
/// 
/// The second string matches ' **This_is-OK** '. We've used the
/// character set abbreviation '\\S' (non-whitespace) and the anchors
/// to match strings which contain no whitespace.
/// 
/// In the following example we match strings containing 'mail' or
/// 'letter' or 'correspondence' but only match whole words i.e. not
/// 'email'
/// 
/// The second string matches . The
/// word 'letter' is also captured (because of the parentheses). We
/// can see what text we've captured like this:
/// 
/// This will capture the text from the first set of capturing
/// parentheses (counting capturing left parentheses from left to
/// right). The parentheses are counted from 1 since cap(0) is the
/// whole matched regexp (equivalent to '&' in most regexp engines).
/// 
/// Here we've passed the QRegExp to QString's replace() function to
/// replace the matched text with new text.
/// 
/// We've used the indexIn() function to repeatedly match the regexp in
/// the string. Note that instead of moving forward by one character
/// at a time `pos++` we could have written `pos +=
/// rx.matchedLength()` to skip over the already matched string. The
/// count will equal 3, matching 'One **Eric** another
/// **Eirik** , and an Ericsson. How many Eiriks, **Eric** ?'; it
/// doesn't match 'Ericsson' or 'Eiriks' because they are not bounded
/// by non-word boundaries.
/// 
/// One common use of regexps is to split lines of delimited data into
/// their component fields.
/// 
/// In this example our input lines have the format company name, web
/// address and country. Unfortunately the regexp is rather long and
/// not very versatile -- the code will break if we add any more
/// fields. A simpler and better solution is to look for the
/// separator, '\\t' in this case, and take the surrounding text. The
/// QString::split() function can take a separator string or regexp
/// as an argument and split a string accordingly.
/// 
/// Here field[0] is the company, field[1] the web address and so on.
/// 
/// To imitate the matching of a shell we can use wildcard mode.
/// 
/// Wildcard matching can be convenient because of its simplicity, but
/// any wildcard regexp can be defined using full regexps, e.g.
/// **.*\\.html$** . Notice that we can't match both `.html` and `.htm` files with a wildcard unless we use ***.htm*** which will
/// also match 'test.html.bak'. A full regexp gives us the precision
/// we need, **.*\\.html?$** .
/// 
/// QRegExp can match case insensitively using setCaseSensitivity(),
/// and can use non-greedy matching, see setMinimal(). By
/// default QRegExp uses full regexps but this can be changed with
/// setPatternSyntax(). Searching can be done forward with indexIn() or backward
/// with lastIndexIn(). Captured text can be accessed using
/// capturedTexts() which returns a string list of all captured
/// strings, or using cap() which returns the captured string for the
/// given index. The pos() function takes a match index and returns
/// the position in the string where the match was made (or -1 if
/// there was no match).
