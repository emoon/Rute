/// 
/// QDataWidgetMapper can be used to create data-aware widgets by mapping
/// them to sections of an item model. A section is a column of a model
/// if the orientation is horizontal (the default), otherwise a row.
/// 
/// Every time the current index changes, each widget is updated with data
/// from the model via the property specified when its mapping was made.
/// If the user edits the contents of a widget, the changes are read using
/// the same property and written back to the model.
/// By default, each widget's [user property](Q_PROPERTY())
/// is used to
/// transfer data between the model and the widget. Since Qt 4.3, an
/// additional addMapping() function enables a named property to be used
/// instead of the default user property.
/// 
/// It is possible to set an item delegate to support custom widgets. By default,
/// a QItemDelegate is used to synchronize the model with the widgets.
/// 
/// Let us assume that we have an item model named `model` with the following contents:
/// 
/// * 1
/// * Qt Norway
/// * Oslo
/// * 2
/// * Qt Australia
/// * Brisbane
/// * 3
/// * Qt USA
/// * Palo Alto
/// * 4
/// * Qt China
/// * Beijing
/// * 5
/// * Qt Germany
/// * Berlin
/// 
/// The following code will map the columns of the model to widgets called `mySpinBox,`
/// `myLineEdit` and `myCountryChooser` :
/// 
/// After the call to toFirst(), `mySpinBox` displays the value `1` , `myLineEdit`
/// displays `Qt Norway` and `myCountryChooser` displays `Oslo` . The
/// navigational functions toFirst(), toNext(), toPrevious(), toLast() and setCurrentIndex()
/// can be used to navigate in the model and update the widgets with contents from
/// the model.
/// 
/// The setRootIndex() function enables a particular item in a model to be
/// specified as the root index - children of this item will be mapped to
/// the relevant widgets in the user interface.
/// 
/// QDataWidgetMapper supports two submit policies, `AutoSubmit` and `ManualSubmit` .
/// `AutoSubmit` will update the model as soon as the current widget loses focus,
/// `ManualSubmit` will not update the model unless submit() is called. `ManualSubmit`
/// is useful when displaying a dialog that lets the user cancel all modifications.
/// Also, other views that display the model won't update until the user finishes
/// all their modifications and submits.
/// 
/// Note that QDataWidgetMapper keeps track of external modifications. If the contents
/// of the model are updated in another module of the application, the widgets are
/// updated as well.
