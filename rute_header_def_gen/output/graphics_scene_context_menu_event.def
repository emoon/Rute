///     \class QGraphicsSceneContextMenuEvent
///     \brief The QGraphicsSceneContextMenuEvent class provides context
///            menu events in the graphics view framework.
///     \since 4.2
///     \ingroup graphicsview-api
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     A QContextMenuEvent received by a QGraphicsView is translated
///     into a QGraphicsSceneContextMenuEvent. The
///     QContextMenuEvent::globalPos() is translated into item, scene, and
///     screen coordinates (pos(), scenePos(), and screenPos()).
