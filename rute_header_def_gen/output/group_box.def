///     \class QGroupBox
///     \brief The QGroupBox widget provides a group box frame with a title.

/// 
///     A group box provides a frame, a title on top, a keyboard shortcut, and
///     displays various other widgets inside itself. The keyboard shortcut moves
///     keyboard focus to one of the group box's child widgets.
/// 
///     QGroupBox also lets you set the \l title (normally set in the
///     constructor) and the title's \l alignment. Group boxes can be
///     \l checkable. Child widgets in checkable group boxes are enabled or
///     disabled depending on whether or not the group box is \l checked.
/// 
///     You can minimize the space consumption of a group box by enabling
///     the \l flat property. In most \l{QStyle}{styles}, enabling this
///     property results in the removal of the left, right and bottom
///     edges of the frame.
/// 
///     QGroupBox doesn't automatically lay out the child widgets (which
///     are often \l{QCheckBox}es or \l{QRadioButton}s but can be any
///     widgets). The following example shows how we can set up a
///     QGroupBox with a layout:
/// 
///     \snippet widgets/groupbox/window.cpp 2
/// 
///     \sa QButtonGroup, {Group Box Example}
struct GroupBox : Widget {
    ///     \property QGroupBox::title
    ///     \brief the group box title text
    /// 
    ///     The group box title text will have a keyboard shortcut if the title
    ///     contains an ampersand ('&') followed by a letter.
    /// 
    ///     \snippet code/src_gui_widgets_qgroupbox.cpp 0
    /// 
    ///     In the example above, \uicontrol Alt+U moves the keyboard focus to the
    ///     group box. See the \l {QShortcut#mnemonic}{QShortcut}
    ///     documentation for details (to display an actual ampersand, use
    ///     '&&').
    /// 
    ///     There is no default title text.

    ///     \property QGroupBox::alignment
    ///     \brief the alignment of the group box title.
    /// 
    ///     Most styles place the title at the top of the frame. The horizontal

    ///     the following list:
    /// 
    ///     \list
    ///     \li Qt::AlignLeft aligns the title text with the left-hand side of the group box.
    ///     \li Qt::AlignRight aligns the title text with the right-hand side of the group box.
    ///     \li Qt::AlignHCenter aligns the title text with the horizontal center of the group box.
    ///     \endlist
