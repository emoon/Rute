///     \class QStyleOptionTabBarBase
///     \brief The QStyleOptionTabBarBase class is used to describe
///     the base of a tab bar, i.e. the part that the tab bar usually
///     overlaps with.
/// 
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     QStyleOptionTabBarBase  contains all the information that QStyle
///     functions need to draw the tab bar base. Note that this is only
///     drawn for a standalone QTabBar (one that isn't part of a
///     QTabWidget).
/// 
///     For performance reasons, the access to the member variables is
///     direct (i.e., using the \c . or \c -> operator). This low-level feel
///     makes the structures straightforward to use and emphasizes that
///     these are simply parameters used by the style functions.
/// 
///     For an example demonstrating how style options can be used, see
///     the \l {widgets/styles}{Styles} example.
/// 
///     \sa QStyleOption, QTabBar::drawBase()
