///     \class QStyleFactory
///     \brief The QStyleFactory class creates QStyle objects.
/// 
///     \ingroup appearance
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     The QStyle class is an abstract base class that encapsulates the
///     look and feel of a GUI. QStyleFactory creates a QStyle object
///     using the create() function and a key identifying the style. The
///     styles are either built-in or dynamically loaded from a style
///     plugin (see QStylePlugin).
/// 
///     The valid keys can be retrieved using the keys()
///     function. Typically they include "windows" and "fusion".
///     Depending on the platform, "windowsvista"
///     and "macintosh" may be available.
///     Note that keys are case insensitive.
/// 
///     \sa QStyle
