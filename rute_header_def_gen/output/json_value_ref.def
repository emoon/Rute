///     \class QJsonValueRef

///     \reentrant
///     \brief The QJsonValueRef class is a helper class for QJsonValue.
/// 
///     \internal
/// 
///     \ingroup json
/// 
///     When you get an object of type QJsonValueRef, if you can assign to it,
///     the assignment will apply to the character in the string from
///     which you got the reference. That is its whole purpose in life.
/// 
///     You can use it exactly in the same way as a reference to a QJsonValue.
/// 
///     The QJsonValueRef becomes invalid once modifications are made to the
///     string: if you want to keep the character, copy it into a QJsonValue.
/// 
///     Most of the QJsonValue member functions also exist in QJsonValueRef.
///     However, they are not explicitly documented here.
