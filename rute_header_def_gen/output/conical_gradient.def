/// 
///     \brief The QConicalGradient class is used in combination with QBrush to
///     specify a conical gradient brush.
/// 
///     Conical gradients interpolate interpolate colors counter-clockwise
///     around a center point.
/// 
///     \image qconicalgradient.png
/// 
///     The colors in a gradient is defined using stop points of the
///     QGradientStop type, i.e. a position and a color. Use the
///     QGradient::setColorAt() or the QGradient::setStops() function to
///     define the stop points. It is the gradient's complete set of stop
///     points that describes how the gradient area should be filled. If
///     no stop points have been specified, a gradient of black at 0 to
///     white at 1 is used.
/// 
///     In addition to the functions inherited from QGradient, the
///     QConicalGradient class provides the angle() and center() functions
///     returning the start angle and center of the gradient.
/// 
///     Note that the setSpread() function has no effect for conical
///     gradients. The reason is that the conical gradient is closed by
///     definition, i.e. the conical gradient fills the entire circle from
///     0 - 360 degrees, while the boundary of a radial or a linear
///     gradient can be specified through its radius or final stop points,
///     respectively.
