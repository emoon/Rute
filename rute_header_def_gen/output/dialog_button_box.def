/// 
/// Dialogs and message boxes typically present buttons in a layout that
/// conforms to the interface guidelines for that platform. Invariably,
/// different platforms have different layouts for their dialogs.
/// QDialogButtonBox allows a developer to add buttons to it and will
/// automatically use the appropriate layout for the user's desktop
/// environment.
/// 
/// Most buttons for a dialog follow certain roles. Such roles include:
/// 
/// * Accepting or rejecting the dialog.
/// * Asking for help.
/// * Performing actions on the dialog itself (such as resetting fields or applying changes).
/// 
/// There can also be alternate ways of dismissing the dialog which may cause
/// destructive results.
/// 
/// Most dialogs have buttons that can almost be considered standard (e.g.
/// **OK** and **Cancel** buttons). It is sometimes convenient to create these
/// buttons in a standard way.
/// 
/// There are a couple ways of using QDialogButtonBox. One ways is to create
/// the buttons (or button texts) yourself and add them to the button box,
/// specifying their role.
/// 
/// Alternatively, QDialogButtonBox provides several standard buttons (e.g. OK, Cancel, Save)
/// that you can use. They exist as flags so you can OR them together in the constructor.
/// 
/// You can mix and match normal buttons and standard buttons.
/// 
/// Currently the buttons are laid out in the following way if the button box is horizontal:
/// * ![GnomeLayout Horizontal](buttonbox-gnomelayout-horizontal.png)
/// 
/// * Button box laid out in horizontal GnomeLayout
/// * ![KdeLayout Horizontal](buttonbox-kdelayout-horizontal.png)
/// 
/// * Button box laid out in horizontal KdeLayout
/// * ![MacLayout Horizontal](buttonbox-maclayout-horizontal.png)
/// 
/// * Button box laid out in horizontal MacLayout
/// * ![WinLayout Horizontal](buttonbox-winlayout-horizontal.png)
/// 
/// * Button box laid out in horizontal WinLayout
/// 
/// The buttons are laid out the following way if the button box is vertical:
/// 
/// * GnomeLayout
/// * KdeLayout
/// * MacLayout
/// * WinLayout
/// * ![GnomeLayout Vertical](buttonbox-gnomelayout-vertical.png)
/// 
/// * ![KdeLayout Vertical](buttonbox-kdelayout-vertical.png)
/// 
/// * ![MacLayout Vertical](buttonbox-maclayout-vertical.png)
/// 
/// * ![WinLayout Vertical](buttonbox-winlayout-vertical.png)
/// 
/// Additionally, button boxes that contain only buttons with ActionRole or
/// HelpRole can be considered modeless and have an alternate look on MacOS :
/// 
/// * modeless horizontal MacLayout
/// * ![Screenshot of modeless horizontal MacLayout](buttonbox-mac-modeless-horizontal.png)
/// 
/// * modeless vertical MacLayout
/// * ![Screenshot of modeless vertical MacLayout](buttonbox-mac-modeless-vertical.png)
/// 
/// When a button is clicked in the button box, the clicked() signal is emitted
/// for the actual button is that is pressed. For convenience, if the button
/// has an AcceptRole, RejectRole, or HelpRole, the accepted(), rejected(), or
/// helpRequested() signals are emitted respectively.
/// 
/// If you want a specific button to be default you need to call
/// QPushButton::setDefault() on it yourself. However, if there is no default
/// button set and to preserve which button is the default button across
/// platforms when using the QPushButton::autoDefault property, the first push
/// button with the accept role is made the default button when the
/// QDialogButtonBox is shown,
///

/// [`PushButton`]
