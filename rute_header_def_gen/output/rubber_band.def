///     \class QRubberBand
///     \brief The QRubberBand class provides a rectangle or line that can
///     indicate a selection or a boundary.
/// 
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     A rubber band is often used to show a new bounding area (as in a
///     QSplitter or a QDockWidget that is undocking). Historically this has
///     been implemented using a QPainter and XOR, but this approach
///     doesn't always work properly since rendering can happen in the
///     window below the rubber band, but before the rubber band has been
///     "erased".
/// 
///     You can create a QRubberBand whenever you need to render a rubber band
///     around a given area (or to represent a single line), then call
///     setGeometry(), move() or resize() to position and size it. A common
///     pattern is to do this in conjunction with mouse events. For example:
/// 
///     \snippet code/src_gui_widgets_qrubberband.cpp 0
/// 
///     If you pass a parent to QRubberBand's constructor, the rubber band will
///     display only inside its parent, but stays on top of other child widgets.
///     If no parent is passed, QRubberBand will act as a top-level widget.
/// 
///     Call show() to make the rubber band visible; also when the
///     rubber band is not a top-level. Hiding or destroying
///     the widget will make the rubber band disappear. The rubber band
///     can be a \l Rectangle or a \l Line (vertical or horizontal),
///     depending on the shape() it was given when constructed.
