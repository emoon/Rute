/// **Keyword**: regular expression match
/// 
/// A QRegularExpressionMatch object can be obtained by calling the
/// QRegularExpression::match() function, or as a single result of a global
/// match from a QRegularExpressionMatchIterator.
/// 
/// The success or the failure of a match attempt can be inspected by calling
/// the hasMatch() function. QRegularExpressionMatch also reports a successful
/// partial match through the hasPartialMatch() function.
/// 
/// In addition, QRegularExpressionMatch returns the substrings captured by the
/// capturing groups in the pattern string. The implicit capturing group with
/// index 0 captures the result of the whole match. The captured() function
/// returns each substring captured, either by the capturing group's index or
/// by its name:
/// 
/// For each captured substring it is possible to query its starting and ending
/// offsets in the subject string by calling the capturedStart() and the
/// capturedEnd() function, respectively. The length of each captured
/// substring is available using the capturedLength() function.
/// 
/// The convenience function capturedTexts() will return *all* the captured
/// substrings at once (including the substring matched by the entire pattern)
/// in the order they have been captured by captring groups; that is,
/// `captured(i) == capturedTexts().at(i)` .
/// 
/// You can retrieve the QRegularExpression object the subject string was
/// matched against by calling the regularExpression() function; the
/// match type and the match options are available as well by calling
/// the matchType() and the matchOptions() respectively.
///
