/// When a QGraphicsView receives a QEvent of type

/// forwarded to the scene. You can set a tooltip on a QGraphicsItem
/// with [setToolTip()](QGraphicsItem::)
/// ; by default QGraphicsScene
/// displays the tooltip of the QGraphicsItem with the highest
/// z-value (i.e, the top-most item) under the mouse position.
/// 
/// QGraphicsView does not forward events when
/// ["What's This"](QWhatsThis)
/// and [status tip](QStatusTipEvent)
/// 
/// help is requested. If you need this, you can reimplement
/// QGraphicsView::viewportEvent() and forward QStatusTipEvent
/// events and [QEvents](QEvent)
/// of type QEvent::WhatsThis to the
/// scene.
