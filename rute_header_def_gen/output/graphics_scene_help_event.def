///     \class QGraphicsSceneHelpEvent
///     \brief The QGraphicsSceneHelpEvent class provides events when a
///            tooltip is requested.
///     \since 4.2
///     \ingroup graphicsview-api
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     When a QGraphicsView receives a QEvent of type
///     QEvent::ToolTip, it creates a QGraphicsSceneHelpEvent, which is
///     forwarded to the scene. You can set a tooltip on a QGraphicsItem
///     with \l{QGraphicsItem::}{setToolTip()}; by default QGraphicsScene
///     displays the tooltip of the QGraphicsItem with the highest
///     z-value (i.e, the top-most item) under the mouse position.
/// 
///     QGraphicsView does not forward events when
///     \l{QWhatsThis}{"What's This"} and \l{QStatusTipEvent}{status tip}
///     help is requested. If you need this, you can reimplement
///     QGraphicsView::viewportEvent() and forward QStatusTipEvent
///     events and \l{QEvent}{QEvents} of type QEvent::WhatsThis to the
///     scene.
///
