/// Modern operating systems usually provide a special area on the desktop,

/// 
/// ![The system tray on Windows XP.](system-tray.png)
/// 
/// The QSystemTrayIcon class can be used on the following platforms:
/// 
/// * All supported versions of Windows.
/// * All window managers and independent tray implementations for X11 that implement the [http://standards.freedesktop.org/systemtray-spec/systemtray-spec-0.2.html freedesktop.org](http://standards.freedesktop.org/systemtray-spec/systemtray-spec-0.2.html%20freedesktop.org)
/// XEmbed system tray specification.
/// * All X11 desktop environments that implement the D-Bus [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/StatusNotifierItem](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/StatusNotifierItem)
/// specification, including recent versions of KDE and Unity.
/// * All supported versions of MacOS .
/// 
/// To check whether a system tray is present on the user's desktop,
/// call the QSystemTrayIcon::isSystemTrayAvailable() static function.
/// 
/// To add a system tray entry, create a QSystemTrayIcon object, call setContextMenu()
/// to provide a context menu for the icon, and call show() to make it visible in the
/// system tray. Status notification messages ("balloon messages") can be displayed at
/// any time using showMessage().
/// 
/// If the system tray is unavailable when a system tray icon is constructed, but
/// becomes available later, QSystemTrayIcon will automatically add an entry for the
/// application in the system tray if the icon is [visible.](visible.)
/// 
/// The activated() signal is emitted when the user activates the icon.
/// 
/// Only on X11, when a tooltip is requested, the QSystemTrayIcon receives a QHelpEvent
/// of type QEvent::ToolTip. Additionally, the QSystemTrayIcon receives wheel events of
/// type QEvent::Wheel. These are not supported on any other platform.
