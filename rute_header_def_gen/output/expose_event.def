///     \since 5.0
///     \brief The QExposeEvent class contains event parameters for expose events.
///     \inmodule QtGui
/// 
///     \ingroup events
/// 
///     Expose events are sent to windows when an area of the window is invalidated
///     or window exposure in the windowing system changes.
/// 
///     A Window with a client area that is completely covered by another window, or
///     is otherwise not visible may be considered obscured by Qt and may in such
///     cases not receive expose events.
/// 
///     The event handler QWindow::exposeEvent() receives expose events.
