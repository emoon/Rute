///     \class QTextLength
///     \reentrant
/// 
///     \brief The QTextLength class encapsulates the different types of length
///     used in a QTextDocument.
///     \inmodule QtGui
/// 
///     \ingroup richtext-processing
/// 
///     When we specify a value for the length of an element in a text document,
///     we often need to provide some other information so that the length is
///     used in the way we expect. For example, when we specify a table width,
///     the value can represent a fixed number of pixels, or it can be a percentage
///     value. This information changes both the meaning of the value and the way
///     it is used.
/// 
///     Generally, this class is used to specify table widths. These can be
///     specified either as a fixed amount of pixels, as a percentage of the
///     containing frame's width, or by a variable width that allows it to take
///     up just the space it requires.
///
