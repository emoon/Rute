/// When we specify a value for the length of an element in a text document,
/// we often need to provide some other information so that the length is
/// used in the way we expect. For example, when we specify a table width,
/// the value can represent a fixed number of pixels, or it can be a percentage
/// value. This information changes both the meaning of the value and the way
/// it is used.
/// 
/// Generally, this class is used to specify table widths. These can be
/// specified either as a fixed amount of pixels, as a percentage of the
/// containing frame's width, or by a variable width that allows it to take
/// up just the space it requires.
