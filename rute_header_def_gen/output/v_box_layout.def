/// 
/// This class is used to construct vertical box layout objects. See
/// QBoxLayout for details.
/// 
/// The simplest use of the class is like this:
/// 
/// First, we create the widgets we want in the layout. Then, we
/// create the QVBoxLayout object and add the widgets into the
/// layout. Finally, we call QWidget::setLayout() to install the
/// QVBoxLayout object onto the widget. At that point, the widgets in
/// the layout are reparented to have `window` as their parent.
