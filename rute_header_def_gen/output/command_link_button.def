/// The command link is a new control that was introduced by Windows Vista. It's
/// intended use is similar to that of a radio button in that it is used to choose
/// between a set of mutually exclusive options. Command link buttons should not
/// be used by themselves but rather as an alternative to radio buttons in
/// Wizards and dialogs and makes pressing the button redundant.
/// The appearance is generally similar to that of a flat pushbutton, but
/// it allows for a descriptive text in addition to the normal button text.
/// By default it will also carry an arrow icon, indicating that pressing the
/// control will open another window or page.
