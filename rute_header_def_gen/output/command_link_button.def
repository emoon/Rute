///     \class QCommandLinkButton
///     \since 4.4
///     \brief The QCommandLinkButton widget provides a Vista style command link button.
/// 
///     \ingroup basicwidgets
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     The command link is a new control that was introduced by Windows Vista. It's
///     intended use is similar to that of a radio button in that it is used to choose
///     between a set of mutually exclusive options. Command link buttons should not
///     be used by themselves but rather as an alternative to radio buttons in
///     Wizards and dialogs and makes pressing the "next" button redundant.
///     The appearance is generally similar to that of a flat pushbutton, but
///     it allows for a descriptive text in addition to the normal button text.
///     By default it will also carry an arrow icon, indicating that pressing the
///     control will open another window or page.
/// 
///     \sa QPushButton, QRadioButton
