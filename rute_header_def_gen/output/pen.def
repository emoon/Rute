/// 
/// A pen has a style(), width(), brush(), capStyle() and joinStyle().
/// 
/// The pen style defines the line type. The brush is used to fill
/// strokes generated with the pen. Use the QBrush class to specify
/// fill styles. The cap style determines the line end caps that can
/// be drawn using QPainter, while the join style describes how joins
/// between two lines are drawn. The pen width can be specified in
/// both integer (width()) and floating point (widthF()) precision. A
/// line width of zero indicates a cosmetic pen. This means that the
/// pen width is always drawn one pixel wide, independent of the [transformation](QPainter%23Coordinate%20Transformations)
/// set on the
/// painter.
/// 
/// The various settings can easily be modified using the
/// corresponding setStyle(), setWidth(), setBrush(), setCapStyle()
/// and setJoinStyle() functions (note that the painter's pen must be
/// reset when altering the pen's properties).
/// 
/// For example:
/// 
/// which is equivalent to
/// 
/// The default pen is a solid black brush with 1 width, square
/// cap style (Qt::SquareCap), and bevel join style (Qt::BevelJoin).
/// 
/// In addition QPen provides the color() and setColor()
/// convenience functions to extract and set the color of the pen's
/// brush, respectively. Pens may also be compared and streamed.
/// 
/// For more information about painting in general, see the [Paint
/// System](Paint%0A%20%20%20%20System)
/// documentation.
/// 
/// # Pen Style
/// 
/// Qt provides several built-in styles represented by the
/// Qt::PenStyle enum:
/// 
/// * ![qpen-solid.png](qpen-solid.png)
/// 
/// * ![qpen-dash.png](qpen-dash.png)
/// 
/// * ![qpen-dot.png](qpen-dot.png)
/// 
/// * Qt::SolidLine
/// * Qt::DashLine
/// * Qt::DotLine
/// 
/// * ![qpen-dashdot.png](qpen-dashdot.png)
/// 
/// * ![qpen-dashdotdot.png](qpen-dashdotdot.png)
/// 
/// * ![qpen-custom.png](qpen-custom.png)
/// 
/// * Qt::DashDotLine
/// * Qt::DashDotDotLine
/// * Qt::CustomDashLine
/// 
/// Simply use the setStyle() function to convert the pen style to
/// either of the built-in styles, except the Qt::CustomDashLine style
/// which we will come back to shortly. Setting the style to Qt::NoPen
/// tells the painter to not draw lines or outlines. The default pen
/// style is Qt::SolidLine.
/// 
/// Since Qt 4.1 it is also possible to specify a custom dash pattern
/// using the setDashPattern() function which implicitly converts the
/// style of the pen to Qt::CustomDashLine. The pattern argument, a
/// QVector, must be specified as an even number of [qreal](qreal)
/// entries
/// where the entries 1, 3, 5... are the dashes and 2, 4, 6... are the
/// spaces. For example, the custom pattern shown above is created
/// using the following code:
/// 
/// Note that the dash pattern is specified in units of the pens
/// width, e.g. a dash of length 5 in width 10 is 50 pixels long.
/// 
/// The currently set dash pattern can be retrieved using the
/// dashPattern() function. Use the isSolid() function to determine
/// whether the pen has a solid fill, or not.
/// 
/// # Cap Style
/// 
/// The cap style defines how the end points of lines are drawn using
/// QPainter. The cap style only apply to wide lines, i.e. when the
/// width is 1 or greater. The Qt::PenCapStyle enum provides the
/// following styles:
/// 
/// * ![qpen-square.png](qpen-square.png)
/// 
/// * ![qpen-flat.png](qpen-flat.png)
/// 
/// * ![qpen-roundcap.png](qpen-roundcap.png)
/// 
/// * Qt::SquareCap
/// * Qt::FlatCap
/// * Qt::RoundCap
/// 
/// The Qt::SquareCap style is a square line end that covers the end
/// point and extends beyond it by half the line width. The
/// Qt::FlatCap style is a square line end that does not cover the end
/// point of the line. And the Qt::RoundCap style is a rounded line
/// end covering the end point.
/// 
/// The default is Qt::SquareCap.
/// 
/// Whether or not end points are drawn when the pen width is 0 or 1
/// depends on the cap style. Using Qt::SquareCap or Qt::RoundCap they
/// are drawn, using Qt::FlatCap they are not drawn.
/// 
/// # Join Style
/// 
/// The join style defines how joins between two connected lines can
/// be drawn using QPainter. The join style only apply to wide lines,
/// i.e. when the width is 1 or greater. The Qt::PenJoinStyle enum
/// provides the following styles:
/// 
/// * ![qpen-bevel.png](qpen-bevel.png)
/// 
/// * ![qpen-miter.png](qpen-miter.png)
/// 
/// * ![qpen-roundjoin.png](qpen-roundjoin.png)
/// 
/// * Qt::BevelJoin
/// * Qt::MiterJoin
/// * Qt::RoundJoin
/// 
/// The Qt::BevelJoin style fills the triangular notch between the two
/// lines. The Qt::MiterJoin style extends the lines to meet at an
/// angle. And the Qt::RoundJoin style fills a circular arc between
/// the two lines.
/// 
/// The default is Qt::BevelJoin.
/// 
/// ![qpen-miterlimit.png](qpen-miterlimit.png)
/// 
/// When the Qt::MiterJoin style is applied, it is possible to use the
/// setMiterLimit() function to specify how far the miter join can
/// extend from the join point. The miterLimit() is used to reduce
/// artifacts between line joins where the lines are close to
/// parallel.
/// 
/// The miterLimit() must be specified in units of the pens width,
/// e.g. a miter limit of 5 in width 10 is 50 pixels long. The
/// default miter limit is 2, i.e. twice the pen width in pixels.
/// 
/// * ![qpen-demo.png](qpen-demo.png)
/// 
/// * **\l {painting/pathstroke** {The Path Stroking Example}} The Path Stroking example shows Qt's built-in dash patterns and shows how custom patterns can be used to extend the range of available patterns.
