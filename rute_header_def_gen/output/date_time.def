/// 
/// A QDateTime object contains a calendar date and a clock time (a
/// ). It is a combination of the QDate and QTime classes.
/// It can read the current datetime from the system clock. It
/// provides functions for comparing datetimes and for manipulating a
/// datetime by adding a number of seconds, days, months, or years.
/// 
/// A QDateTime object is typically created either by giving a date
/// and time explicitly in the constructor, or by using the static
/// function currentDateTime() that returns a QDateTime object set
/// to the system clock's time. The date and time can be changed with
/// setDate() and setTime(). A datetime can also be set using the
/// setTime_t() function that takes a POSIX-standard value. The fromString()
/// function returns a QDateTime, given a string and a date format
/// used to interpret the date within the string.
/// 
/// The date() and time() functions provide access to the date and
/// time parts of the datetime. The same information is provided in
/// textual format by the toString() function.
/// 
/// QDateTime provides a full set of operators to compare two
/// QDateTime objects, where smaller means earlier and larger means
/// later.
/// 
/// You can increment (or decrement) a datetime by a given number of
/// milliseconds using addMSecs(), seconds using addSecs(), or days
/// using addDays(). Similarly, you can use addMonths() and addYears().
/// The daysTo() function returns the number of days between two datetimes,
/// secsTo() returns the number of seconds between two datetimes, and
/// msecsTo() returns the number of milliseconds between two datetimes.
/// 
/// QDateTime can store datetimes as [local time](Qt::LocalTime)
/// or
/// as [UTC](Qt::UTC)
/// . QDateTime::currentDateTime() returns a
/// QDateTime expressed as local time; use toUTC() to convert it to
/// UTC. You can also use timeSpec() to find out if a QDateTime
/// object stores a UTC time or a local time. Operations such as
/// addSecs() and secsTo() are aware of daylight-saving time (DST).
/// 
/// **Note**: QDateTime does not account for leap seconds.
/// 
/// # Remarks
/// 
/// ## No Year 0
/// 
/// There is no year 0. Dates in that year are considered invalid. The
/// year -1 is the year or
/// The day before 1 January 1 CE is 31 December 1 BCE.
/// 
/// ## Range of Valid Dates
/// 
/// The range of valid values able to be stored in QDateTime is dependent on
/// the internal storage implementation. QDateTime is currently stored in a
/// qint64 as a serial msecs value encoding the date and time. This restricts
/// the date range to about +/- 292 million years, compared to the QDate range
/// of +/- 2 billion years. Care must be taken when creating a QDateTime with
/// extreme values that you do not overflow the storage. The exact range of
/// supported values varies depending on the Qt::TimeSpec and time zone.
/// 
/// ## Use of System Timezone
/// 
/// QDateTime uses the system's time zone information to determine the
/// offset of local time from UTC. If the system is not configured
/// correctly or not up-to-date, QDateTime will give wrong results as
/// well.
/// 
/// ## Daylight-Saving Time (DST)
/// 
/// QDateTime takes into account the system's time zone information
/// when dealing with DST. On modern Unix systems, this means it
/// applies the correct historical DST data whenever possible. On
/// Windows, where the system doesn't support historical DST data,
/// historical accuracy is not maintained with respect to DST.
/// 
/// The range of valid dates taking DST into account is 1970-01-01 to
/// the present, and rules are in place for handling DST correctly
/// until 2037-12-31, but these could change. For dates falling
/// outside that range, QDateTime makes a *best guess* using the
/// rules for year 1970 or 2037, but we can't guarantee accuracy. This
/// means QDateTime doesn't take into account changes in a locale's
/// time zone before 1970, even if the system's time zone database
/// supports that information.
/// 
/// QDateTime takes into consideration the Standard Time to Daylight-Saving Time
/// transition. For example if the transition is at 2am and the clock goes
/// forward to 3am, then there is a hour from 02:00:00 to 02:59:59.999
/// which QDateTime considers to be invalid. Any date maths performed
/// will take this missing hour into account and return a valid result.
/// 
/// ## Offset From UTC
/// 
/// A Qt::TimeSpec of Qt::OffsetFromUTC is also supported. This allows you
/// to define a QDateTime relative to UTC at a fixed offset of a given number
/// of seconds from UTC. For example, an offset of +3600 seconds is one hour
/// ahead of UTC and is usually written in ISO standard notation as
/// . Daylight-Saving Time never applies with this TimeSpec.
/// 
/// There is no explicit size restriction to the offset seconds, but there is
/// an implicit limit imposed when using the toString() and fromString()
/// methods which use a format of [+|-]hh:mm, effectively limiting the range
/// to +/- 99 hours and 59 minutes and whole minutes only. Note that currently
/// no time zone lies outside the range of +/- 14 hours.
/// 
/// ## Time Zone Support
/// 
/// A Qt::TimeSpec of Qt::TimeZone is also supported in conjunction with the
/// QTimeZone class. This allows you to define a datetime in a named time zone
/// adhering to a consistent set of daylight-saving transition rules. For
/// example a time zone of will apply the daylight-saving
/// rules as used in Germany since 1970. Note that the transition rules
/// applied depend on the platform support. See the QTimeZone documentation
/// for more details.
