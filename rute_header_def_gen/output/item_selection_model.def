/// 
/// A QItemSelectionModel keeps track of the selected items in a view, or
/// in several views onto the same model. It also keeps track of the
/// currently selected item in a view.
/// 
/// The QItemSelectionModel class is one of the [Model/View Classes](Model/View%20Classes)
/// and is part of Qt's [model/view framework](Model/View%20Programming)
/// 
/// 
/// The selected items are stored using ranges. Whenever you want to
/// modify the selected items use select() and provide either a
/// QItemSelection, or a QModelIndex and a QItemSelectionModel::SelectionFlag.
/// 
/// The QItemSelectionModel takes a two layer approach to selection
/// management, dealing with both selected items that have been committed
/// and items that are part of the current selection. The current
/// selected items are part of the current interactive selection (for
/// example with rubber-band selection or keyboard-shift selections).
/// 
/// To update the currently selected items, use the bitwise OR of
/// QItemSelectionModel::Current and any of the other SelectionFlags.
/// If you omit the QItemSelectionModel::Current command, a new current
/// selection will be created, and the previous one added to the whole
/// selection. All functions operate on both layers; for example,
/// [selecteditems()](QTableWidget::selectedItems())
/// will return items from both layers.
/// 
/// **Note**: Since 5.5, [model](QItemSelectionModel::model())
/// 
/// [hasSelection](QItemSelectionModel::hasSelection())
/// , and
/// [currentIndex](QItemSelectionModel::currentIndex())
/// are meta-object properties.
