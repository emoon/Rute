/// 
/// QFontMetricsF functions calculate the size of characters and
/// strings for a given font. You can construct a QFontMetricsF object
/// with an existing QFont to obtain metrics for that font. If the
/// font is changed later, the font metrics object is *not* updated.
/// 
/// Once created, the object provides functions to access the
/// individual metrics of the font, its characters, and for strings
/// rendered in the font.
/// 
/// There are several functions that operate on the font: ascent(),
/// descent(), height(), leading() and lineSpacing() return the basic
/// size properties of the font. The underlinePos(), overlinePos(),
/// strikeOutPos() and lineWidth() functions, return the properties of
/// the line that underlines, overlines or strikes out the
/// characters. These functions are all fast.
/// 
/// There are also some functions that operate on the set of glyphs in
/// the font: minLeftBearing(), minRightBearing() and maxWidth().
/// These are by necessity slow, and we recommend avoiding them if
/// possible.
/// 
/// For each character, you can get its width(), leftBearing() and
/// rightBearing() and find out whether it is in the font using
/// inFont(). You can also treat the character as a string, and use
/// the string functions on it.
/// 
/// The string functions include width(), to return the width of a
/// string in pixels (or points, for a printer), boundingRect(), to
/// return a rectangle large enough to contain the rendered string,
/// and size(), to return the size of that rectangle.
