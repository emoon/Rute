/// 
/// A tab widget provides a tab bar (see QTabBar) and a
/// that is used to display pages related to each tab. By default, the
/// tab bar is shown above the page area, but different configurations
/// are available (see [TabPosition](TabPosition)
/// ). Each tab is associated with a
/// different widget (called a page). Only the current page is shown in
/// the page area; all the other pages are hidden. The user can show a
/// different page by clicking on its tab or by pressing its
/// Alt+ *letter* shortcut if it has one.
/// 
/// The normal way to use QTabWidget is to do the following:
/// * Create a QTabWidget.
/// * Create a QWidget for each of the pages in the tab dialog, but do not specify parent widgets for them.
/// * Insert child widgets into the page widget, using layouts to position them as normal.
/// * Call addTab() or insertTab() to put the page widgets into the tab widget, giving each tab a suitable label with an optional keyboard shortcut.
/// 
/// The position of the tabs is defined by [tabPosition,](tabPosition,)
/// their shape
/// by [tabShape.](tabShape.)
/// 
/// The signal currentChanged() is emitted when the user selects a
/// page.
/// 
/// The current page index is available as currentIndex(), the current
/// page widget with currentWidget(). You can retrieve a pointer to a
/// page widget with a given index using widget(), and can find the
/// index position of a widget with indexOf(). Use setCurrentWidget()
/// or setCurrentIndex() to show a particular page.
/// 
/// You can change a tab's text and icon using setTabText() or
/// setTabIcon(). A tab and its associated page can be removed with
/// removeTab().
/// 
/// Each tab is either enabled or disabled at any given time (see
/// setTabEnabled()). If a tab is enabled, the tab text is drawn
/// normally and the user can select that tab. If it is disabled, the
/// tab is drawn in a different way and the user cannot select that
/// tab. Note that even if a tab is disabled, the page can still be
/// visible, for example if all of the tabs happen to be disabled.
/// 
/// Tab widgets can be a very good way to split up a complex dialog.
/// An alternative is to use a QStackedWidget for which you provide some
/// means of navigating between pages, for example, a QToolBar or a
/// QListWidget.
/// 
/// Most of the functionality in QTabWidget is provided by a QTabBar
/// (at the top, providing the tabs) and a QStackedWidget (most of the
/// area, organizing the individual pages).
