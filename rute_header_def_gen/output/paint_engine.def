/// 
/// Qt provides several premade implementations of QPaintEngine for the
/// different painter backends we support. The primary paint engine
/// provided is the raster paint engine, which contains a software
/// rasterizer which supports the full feature set on all supported platforms.
/// This is the default for painting on QWidget-based classes in e.g. on Windows,
/// X11 and MacOS , it is the backend for painting on QImage and it is
/// used as a fallback for paint engines that do not support a certain
/// capability. In addition we provide QPaintEngine implementations for
/// OpenGL (accessible through QGLWidget) and printing (which allows using
/// QPainter to draw on a QPrinter object).
/// 
/// If one wants to use QPainter to draw to a different backend,
/// one must subclass QPaintEngine and reimplement all its virtual
/// functions. The QPaintEngine implementation is then made available by
/// subclassing QPaintDevice and reimplementing the virtual function
/// QPaintDevice::paintEngine().
/// 
/// QPaintEngine is created and owned by the QPaintDevice that created it.
///
