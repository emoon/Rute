/// 
/// In Qt there is a often a need to represent the layout of the pixels in a
/// graphics buffer. Internally QPixelFormat stores everything in a 64 bit
/// datastructure. This gives performance but also some limitations.
/// 
/// QPixelFormat can describe 5 color channels and 1 alpha channel, each can use
/// 6 bits to describe the size of the color channel.
/// 
/// The position of the alpha channel is described with a separate enum. This is
/// to make it possible to describe QImage formats like ARGB32, and also
/// describe typical OpenGL formats like RBGA8888.
/// 
/// How pixels are suppose to be read is determined by the TypeInterpretation
/// enum. It describes if color values are suppose to be read byte per byte,
/// or if a pixel is suppose to be read as a complete int and then masked.
/// **See also:** TypeInterpretation
/// 
/// There is no support for describing YUV's macro pixels. Instead a list of YUV
/// formats has been made. When a QPixelFormat is describing a YUV format, the
/// bitsPerPixel value has been deduced by the YUV Layout enum. Also, the color
/// channels should all be set to zero except the fifth color channel that
/// should store the bitsPerPixel value.
