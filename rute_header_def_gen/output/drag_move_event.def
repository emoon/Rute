///     \class QDragMoveEvent
///     \brief The QDragMoveEvent class provides an event which is sent while a drag and drop action is in progress.
/// 
///     \ingroup events
///     \ingroup draganddrop
///     \inmodule QtGui
/// 
///     A widget will receive drag move events repeatedly while the drag
///     is within its boundaries, if it accepts
///     \l{QWidget::setAcceptDrops()}{drop events} and \l
///     {QWidget::dragEnterEvent()}{enter events}. The widget should
///     examine the event to see what kind of \l{mimeData()}{data} it
///     provides, and call the accept() function to accept the drop if appropriate.
/// 
///     The rectangle supplied by the answerRect() function can be used to restrict
///     drops to certain parts of the widget. For example, we can check whether the
///     rectangle intersects with the geometry of a certain child widget and only
///     call \l{QDropEvent::acceptProposedAction()}{acceptProposedAction()} if that
///     is the case.
/// 
///     Note that this class inherits most of its functionality from
///     QDropEvent.
/// 
///     \sa QDragEnterEvent, QDragLeaveEvent, QDropEvent
struct DragMoveEvent : DropEvent {
    answer_rect() -> Rect,
    accept(),
    ignore(),
    accept(r: &RectType),
    ignore(r: &RectType),
