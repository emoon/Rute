/// Debug messages are usually created by the OpenGL server and then read by

/// 
/// It's also possible for applications or third-party libraries and toolkits
/// to create and insert messages in the debug log. In order to do so, you can use
/// the createApplicationMessage() or the createThirdPartyMessage() static functions.
