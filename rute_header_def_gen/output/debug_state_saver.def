///     \class QDebugStateSaver
///     \inmodule QtCore
///     \brief Convenience class for custom QDebug operators.
/// 
///     Saves the settings used by QDebug, and restores them upon destruction,
///     then calls \l {QDebug::maybeSpace()}{maybeSpace()}, to separate arguments with a space if
///     \l {QDebug::autoInsertSpaces()}{autoInsertSpaces()} was true at the time of constructing the QDebugStateSaver.
/// 
///     The automatic insertion of spaces between writes is one of the settings
///     that QDebugStateSaver stores for the duration of the current block.
/// 
///     The settings of the internal QTextStream are also saved and restored,
///     so that using << hex in a QDebug operator doesn't affect other QDebug
///     operators.
/// 
///     \since 5.1
