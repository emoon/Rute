///     \brief The QScrollEvent class is sent when scrolling.
/// 
///     The scroll event is sent to indicate that the receiver should be scrolled.
///     Usually the receiver should be something visual like QWidget or QGraphicsObject.
/// 
///     Some care should be taken that no conflicting QScrollEvents are sent from two
///     sources. Using QScroller::scrollTo is save however.
