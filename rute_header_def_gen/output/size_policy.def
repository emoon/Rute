/// 
/// The size policy of a widget is an expression of its willingness to
/// be resized in various ways, and affects how the widget is treated
/// by the [layout engine](Layout%20Management)
/// . Each widget returns a
/// QSizePolicy that describes the horizontal and vertical resizing
/// policy it prefers when being laid out. You can change this for
/// a specific widget by changing its QWidget::sizePolicy property.
/// 
/// QSizePolicy contains two independent QSizePolicy::Policy values
/// and two stretch factors; one describes the widgets's horizontal
/// size policy, and the other describes its vertical size policy. It
/// also contains a flag to indicate whether the height and width of
/// its preferred size are related.
/// 
/// The horizontal and vertical policies can be set in the
/// constructor, and altered using the setHorizontalPolicy() and
/// setVerticalPolicy() functions. The stretch factors can be set
/// using the setHorizontalStretch() and setVerticalStretch()
/// functions. The flag indicating whether the widget's
/// [sizeHint()](QWidget::sizeHint())
/// is width-dependent (such as a
/// menu bar or a word-wrapping label) can be set using the
/// setHeightForWidth() function.
/// 
/// The current size policies and stretch factors be retrieved using
/// the horizontalPolicy(), verticalPolicy(), horizontalStretch() and
/// verticalStretch() functions. Alternatively, use the transpose()
/// function to swap the horizontal and vertical policies and
/// stretches. The hasHeightForWidth() function returns the current
/// status of the flag indicating the size hint dependencies.
/// 
/// Use the expandingDirections() function to determine whether the
/// associated widget can make use of more space than its
/// [sizeHint()](QWidget::sizeHint())
/// function indicates, as well as
/// find out in which directions it can expand.
/// 
/// Finally, the QSizePolicy class provides operators comparing this
/// size policy to a given policy, as well as a QVariant operator
/// storing this QSizePolicy as a QVariant object.
