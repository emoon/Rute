///     \class QNativeGestureEvent
///     \since 5.2
///     \brief The QNativeGestureEvent class contains parameters that describe a gesture event.
///     \inmodule QtGui
///     \ingroup events
/// 
///     Native gesture events are generated by the operating system, typically by
///     interpreting touch events. Gesture events are high-level events such
///     as zoom or rotate.
/// 
///     \table
///     \header
///         \li Event Type
///         \li Description
///         \li Touch sequence
///     \row
///         \li Qt::ZoomNativeGesture
///         \li Magnification delta in percent.
///         \li \macos: Two-finger pinch.
///     \row
///         \li Qt::SmartZoomNativeGesture
///         \li Boolean magnification state.
///         \li \macos: Two-finger douple tap (trackpad) / One-finger douple tap (magic mouse).
///     \row
///         \li Qt::RotateNativeGesture
///         \li Rotation delta in degrees.
///         \li \macos: Two-finger rotate.
///     \endtable

///     In addition, BeginNativeGesture and EndNativeGesture are sent before and after
///     gesture event streams:
/// 
///         BeginNativeGesture
///         ZoomNativeGesture
///         ZoomNativeGesture
///         ZoomNativeGesture
///         EndNativeGesture
