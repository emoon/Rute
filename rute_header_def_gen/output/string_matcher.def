/// 
/// This class is useful when you have a sequence of [QChar](QChar)
/// s that
/// you want to repeatedly match against some strings (perhaps in a
/// loop), or when you want to search for the same sequence of
/// characters multiple times in the same string. Using a matcher
/// object and indexIn() is faster than matching a plain QString with
/// QString::indexOf() if repeated matching takes place. This class
/// offers no benefit if you are doing one-off string matches.
/// 
/// Create the QStringMatcher with the QString you want to search
/// for. Then call indexIn() on the QString that you want to search.
