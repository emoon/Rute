///     \class QStringMatcher
///     \inmodule QtCore
///     \brief The QStringMatcher class holds a sequence of characters that
///     can be quickly matched in a Unicode string.
/// 
///     \ingroup tools
///     \ingroup string-processing
/// 
///     This class is useful when you have a sequence of \l{QChar}s that
///     you want to repeatedly match against some strings (perhaps in a
///     loop), or when you want to search for the same sequence of
///     characters multiple times in the same string. Using a matcher
///     object and indexIn() is faster than matching a plain QString with
///     QString::indexOf() if repeated matching takes place. This class
///     offers no benefit if you are doing one-off string matches.
/// 
///     Create the QStringMatcher with the QString you want to search
///     for. Then call indexIn() on the QString that you want to search.
/// 
///     \sa QString, QByteArrayMatcher, QRegExp

    ///     character position \a from (default 0, i.e. from the first
    ///     character), for the string pattern() that was set in the
    ///     constructor or in the most recent call to setPattern(). Returns
    ///     the position where the pattern() matched in \a str, or -1 if no
    ///     match was found.
