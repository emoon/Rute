///     \class QGraphicsSceneEvent
///     \brief The QGraphicsSceneEvent class provides a base class for all
///     graphics view related events.
///     \since 4.2
///     \ingroup graphicsview-api
///     \inmodule QtWidgets
/// 
///     When a QGraphicsView receives Qt mouse, keyboard, and drag and
///     drop events (QMouseEvent, QKeyEvent, QDragEvent, etc.), it
///     translates them into instances of QGraphicsSceneEvent subclasses
///     and forwards them to the QGraphicsScene it displays. The scene
///     then forwards the events to the relevant items.
/// 
///     For example, when a QGraphicsView receives a QMouseEvent of type
///     MousePress as a response to a user click, the view sends a
///     QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent of type GraphicsSceneMousePress to the
///     underlying QGraphicsScene through its
///     \l{QGraphicsScene::}{mousePressEvent()} function. The default
///     QGraphicsScene::mousePressEvent() implementation determines which
///     item was clicked and forwards the event to
///     QGraphicsItem::mousePressEvent().
/// 
///     \omit ### Beskrive widget() \endomit
/// 
///     Subclasses such as QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent and
///     QGraphicsSceneContextMenuEvent provide the coordinates from the
///     original QEvent in screen, scene, and item coordinates (see
///     \l{QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent::}{screenPos()},
///     \l{QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent::}{scenePos()}, and
///     \l{QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent::}{pos()}). The item coordinates are
///     set by the QGraphicsScene before it forwards the event to the
///     event to a QGraphicsItem. The mouse events also add the
///     possibility to retrieve the coordinates from the last event
///     received by the view (see
///     \l{QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent::}{lastScreenPos()},
///     \l{QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent::}{lastScenePos()}, and
///     \l{QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent::}{lastPos()}).
