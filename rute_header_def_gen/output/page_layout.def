/// 
/// The QPageLayout class defines the layout of a page in a paged document, with the
/// page size, orientation and margins able to be set and the full page and paintable
/// page rectangles defined by those attributes able to be queried in a variety of units.
/// 
/// The page size is defined by the QPageSize class which can be queried for page size
/// attributes. Note that the QPageSize itself is always defined in a Portrait
/// orientation.
/// 
/// The minimum margins can be defined for the layout but normally default to 0.
/// When used in conjunction with Qt's printing support the minimum margins
/// will reflect the minimum printable area defined by the printer.
/// 
/// In the default StandardMode the current margins and minimum margins are
/// always taken into account. The paintable rectangle is the full page
/// rectangle less the current margins, and the current margins can only be set
/// to values between the minimum margins and the maximum margins allowed by
/// the full page size.
/// 
/// In FullPageMode the current margins and minimum margins are not taken
/// into account. The paintable rectangle is the full page rectangle, and the
/// current margins can be set to any values regardless of the minimum margins
/// and page size.
