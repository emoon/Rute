///     \class QPaintEvent
///     \brief The QPaintEvent class contains event parameters for paint events.
///     \inmodule QtGui
/// 
///     \ingroup events
/// 
///     Paint events are sent to widgets that need to update themselves,
///     for instance when part of a widget is exposed because a covering
///     widget was moved.
/// 
///     The event contains a region() that needs to be updated, and a
///     rect() that is the bounding rectangle of that region. Both are
///     provided because many widgets cannot make much use of region(),
///     and rect() can be much faster than region().boundingRect().
/// 
///     \section1 Automatic Clipping
/// 
///     Painting is clipped to region() during the processing of a paint
///     event. This clipping is performed by Qt's paint system and is
///     independent of any clipping that may be applied to a QPainter used to
///     draw on the paint device.
/// 
///     As a result, the value returned by QPainter::clipRegion() on
///     a newly-constructed QPainter will not reflect the clip region that is
///     used by the paint system.
///
