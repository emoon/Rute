/// 
/// Paint events are sent to widgets that need to update themselves,
/// for instance when part of a widget is exposed because a covering
/// widget was moved.
/// 
/// The event contains a region() that needs to be updated, and a
/// rect() that is the bounding rectangle of that region. Both are
/// provided because many widgets cannot make much use of region(),
/// and rect() can be much faster than region().boundingRect().
/// 
/// # Automatic Clipping
/// 
/// Painting is clipped to region() during the processing of a paint
/// event. This clipping is performed by Qt's paint system and is
/// independent of any clipping that may be applied to a QPainter used to
/// draw on the paint device.
/// 
/// As a result, the value returned by QPainter::clipRegion() on
/// a newly-constructed QPainter will not reflect the clip region that is
/// used by the paint system.
