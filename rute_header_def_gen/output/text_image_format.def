///     \class QTextImageFormat
///     \reentrant
/// 
///     \brief The QTextImageFormat class provides formatting information for
///     images in a QTextDocument.
///     \inmodule QtGui
/// 
///     \ingroup richtext-processing
///     \ingroup shared
/// 
///     Inline images are represented by a Unicode value U+FFFC (OBJECT
///     REPLACEMENT CHARACTER) which has an associated QTextImageFormat. The
///     image format specifies a name with setName() that is used to
///     locate the image. The size of the rectangle that the image will
///     occupy is specified using setWidth() and setHeight().
/// 
///     Images can be supplied in any format for which Qt has an image
///     reader, so SVG drawings can be included alongside PNG, TIFF and
///     other bitmap formats.
/// 
///     \sa QImage, QImageReader
